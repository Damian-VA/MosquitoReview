We applied phylogenetic hierarchical models to a data set of 2,171 Western Palearctic individual birds from 47 species to determine how climate and landscape variation influence infection probability for three genera of haemosporidian blood parasites (Haemoproteus,Leucocytozoon, andPlasmodium). Our comparative models found compelling evidence that birds in areas with higher vegetation density (captured by the normalized difference vegetation index [NDVI]) had higher likelihoods of carrying parasite infection. Magnitudes of this relationship were remarkably similar across parasite genera considering that these parasites use different arthropod vectors and are widely presumed to be epidemiologically distinct. However, we also uncovered key differences among genera that highlighted complexities in their climate responses. In particular, prevalences ofHaemoproteusandPlasmodiumshowed strong but contrasting relationships with winter temperatures, supporting mounting evidence that winter warming is a key environmental filter impacting the dynamics of host-parasite interactions. Parasite phylogenetic community diversities demonstrated a clear but contrasting latitudinal gradient, withHaemoproteusdiversity increasing towards the equator andLeucocytozoondiversity increasing towards the poles.Haemoproteusdiversity also increased in regions with higher vegetation density, supporting our evidence that summer vegetation density is important for structuring the distributions of these parasites. Ongoing variation in winter temperatures and vegetation characteristics will probably have far-reaching consequences for the transmission and spread of vector-borne diseases.","[Clark, Nicholas J.] Univ Queensland, Sch Vet Sci, UQ Spatial Epidemiol Lab, Gatton, Qld, Australia; [Drovetski, Sergei, V] US Geol Survey, Patuxent Wildlife Res Ctr, Beltsville, MD USA; [Voelker, Gary] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Ecol & Conservat Biol, College Stn, TX USA","Clark, NJ (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Vet Sci, UQ Spatial Epidemiol Lab, Gatton, Qld, Australia.",nicholas.j.clark@gmail.com,,"Drovetski, Serguei/0000-0002-1832-5597","National Geographic SocietyNational Geographic Society; COMPETE programme; Fundaca o para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia/MEC [FCOMP-01-0124-FEDER-008941, PTDC/BIA-BEC/103435/2008]","National Geographic Society; COMPETE programme, Grant/Award Number: POPH/QREN/FSE; Fundaca o para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia/MEC, Grant/Award Number: FCOMP-01-0124-FEDER-008941 and PTDC/BIA-BEC/103435/2008",,83,0,0,8,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0962-1083,1365-294X,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

Evolution in this field has helped in the introduction of various initiatives related to public health informatics. Surveillance systems in the area of health informatics utilizing social media information have been developed for early prediction of disease outbreaks and to monitor diseases. In the past few years, the availability of social media data, particularly Twitter data, enabled real-time syndromic surveillance that provides immediate analysis and instant feedback to those who are charged with follow-ups and investigation of potential outbreaks. In this paper, we review the recent work, trends, and machine learning(ML) text classification approaches used by surveillance systems seeking social media data in the healthcare domain. We also highlight the limitations and challenges followed by possible future directions that can be taken further in this domain. Methods: To study the landscape of research in health informatics performing surveillance of the various health-related data posted on social media or web-based platforms, we present a bibliometric analysis of the 1240 publications indexed in multiple scientific databases (IEEE, ACM Digital Library, ScienceDirect, PubMed) from the year 2010-2018. The papers were further reviewed based on the various machine learning algorithms used for analyzing health-related text posted on social media platforms. Findings:: Based on the corpus of 148 selected articles, the study finds the types of social media or web-based platforms used for surveillance in the healthcare domain, along with the health topic(s) studied by them. In the corpus of selected articles, we found 26 articles were using machine learning technique. These articles were studied to find commonly used ML techniques. The majority of studies (24%) focused on the surveillance of flu or influenza-like illness (ILI). Twitter (64%) is the most popular data source to perform surveillance research using social media text data, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) (33%) being the most used ML algorithm for text classification. Conclusions: The inclusion of online data in surveillance systems has improved the disease prediction ability over traditional syndromic surveillance systems. However, social media based surveillance systems have many limitations and challenges, including noise, demographic bias, privacy issues, etc. Our paper mentions future directions, which can be useful for researchers working in the area. Researchers can use this paper as a library for social media based surveillance systems in the healthcare domain and can expand such systems by incorporating the future works discussed in our paper.","[Gupta, Aakansha; Katarya, Rahul] Delhi Technol Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Delhi 110042, India","Katarya, R (corresponding author), Delhi Technol Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Delhi 110042, India.",,,"Katarya, Dr. Rahul/0000-0001-7763-291X; Gupta, Aakansha/0000-0001-7100-0014",,,,133,1,1,11,11,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",1532-0464,1532-0480,,J BIOMED INFORM,J.

Although the impact of temperature on vector-borne disease dynamics has been studied intensively, the actual temperature encountered by the vector in a heterogeneous landscape is rarely taken into account. If disease vectors have temperature preferences and therefore select specific microhabitats, this would substantially influence key life history traits that determine transmission intensity. The thermal preferences of subtropical Aedes aegypti and temperate Ae. japonicus mosquitoes were investigated in a temperature gradient setup consisting of a Plexiglas box on top of an aluminium plate on two thermal regulators. Blood-fed (one day after feeding) and unfed (non-blood-fed) mosquitoes were released in small (15-20 degrees C, 20-25 degrees C, 25-30 degrees C) and large (15-30 degrees C, 30-45 degrees C) temperature gradients to assess their thermal preferences after 15 min. Additionally, the effect of humidity was investigated in a two-choice chamber setup. Both mosquito species avoided higher temperatures, pronouncedly dangerously high temperatures in the 30-45 degrees C gradient. At lower temperatures, blood-fed mosquitoes preferred the cooler sides of the 20-25 degrees C and 25-30 degrees C gradient, which were all below their rearing temperature. In the lowest gradient of 15-20 degrees C, no preferences were found. The thermal preference of unfed mosquitoes was similar to that of the blood-fed mosquitoes. No humidity preference or effect of humidity on temperature preferences was observed within the tested range (40-90%). The set-up allows for assessing the thermal preference of mosquitoes under controlled conditions. The observed preference of mosquitoes for cooler temperatures would increase their longevity and slow down pathogen development. If similar micmhabitat selection is observed in the field, vector borne disease models should be adjusted accordingly.","[Verhulst, Niels O.; Brendle, Alexsandra; Mathis, Alexander] Univ Zurich, Vetsuisse Fac, Natl Ctr Vector Entomol, Inst Parasitol, Winterthurerstr 266A, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Blanckenhorn, Wolf U.] Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Zurich, Switzerland","Verhulst, NO (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Vetsuisse Fac, Natl Ctr Vector Entomol, Inst Parasitol, Winterthurerstr 266A, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",Niels.Verhulst@uzh.ch,,"Verhulst, Niels/0000-0002-1106-9711",Swiss Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office of the Swiss National Centre for Vector Entomology,We thank Jeannine Hauri for mosquito rearing.

Rapid expansion of urban populations and alteration of natural habitats creates the opportunity for arboviruses to host-switch from wild, sylvatic hosts or vectors into urban transmission affecting human populations. Although mosquito surveillance regularly takes place in urban areas of Kenya, for example identifying vectors of dengue virus or malaria viruses, little work has been carried out to determine the distribution and abundance of sylvatic vectors. Here, we describe the mosquito vector species and diversity collected at twelve forest habitats of rural Kenya. We conducted arbovirus screening of over 14,082 mosquitoes (47 species, 11 genera) as 1520 pools, and detected seven viruses (six bunyaviruses, and one flavivirus-bunyavirus co-infection) isolated from pools ofAedes dentatus,Anopheles funestus,Culex annulioris,andCx. vansomereni. Awareness of sylvatic vector species and their location is a critical part of understanding the ecological foci and enzootic cycling of pathogens that may be of concern to public, animal or wildlife health. As natural ecosystems come under anthropogenic pressures, such knowledge can inform us of the One Health potential for spillover or spillback leading to outbreaks, and assist in vector control strategies.","[Eastwood, Gillian] Univ Texas Med Branch, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Ctr Trop Dis, Inst Human Infect & Immun, Galveston, TX 77555 USA; [Eastwood, Gillian] Virginia Tech, Coll Agr & Life Sci, Blacksburg, VA 24060 USA; [Sang, Rosemary C.; Lutomiah, Joel; Tunge, Philip] Kenya Govt Med Res Ctr, Ctr Viral Res, Mbagathi Way, Nairobi, Kenya; [Weaver, Scott C.] Univ Texas Med Branch, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, World Reference Ctr Emerging Viruses & Arboviruse, Inst Human Infect & Immun,Ctr Trop Dis, Galveston, TX 77555 USA","Eastwood, G (corresponding author), Univ Texas Med Branch, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Ctr Trop Dis, Inst Human Infect & Immun, Galveston, TX 77555 USA.; Eastwood, G (corresponding author), Virginia Tech, Coll Agr & Life Sci, Blacksburg, VA 24060 USA.",geastwood@vt.edu; Rosemary.Sang@usamru-k.org; joel.lutomiah@usamru-k.org; tungephilip@gmail.com; sweaver@utmb.edu,"; Weaver, Scott/D-6490-2011","Eastwood, Gillian/0000-0002-9683-0353; Weaver, Scott/0000-0001-8016-8556","University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston; UTMB Institute for Human Infections and Immunity; World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses, NIH grantUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R24AI120942]","A McLaughlin Endowment Post-Doctoral Fellowship awarded to G.E. from the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston supported this work.

Many of these diseases are well-known among veterinary practitioners and some of them are called emerging diseases as prevalence, temporal and spatial distribution seem to increase in Europe. The number of newly recognized pathogens, transmitted by a variety of arthropod vectors, that are relevant for dogs and cats, is also increasing every year. The prevalence among infected vectors and hosts is a hot topic in veterinary science throughout the entire continent, as well as the development of efficient diagnostic procedures, therapy and prophylactic measures. Companion animal vector-borne diseases comprise a large group of pathogens including viruses, bacteria, protozoa and helminths. These pathogens are mainly transmitted by bloodsucking arthropods (ticks, fleas, mosquitos, sand flies), and more seldom by direct transmission between vertebrate hosts. Vector prevalence and activity is influenced by local climate conditions, host species density, changes in landscape and land use. Human parameters such as poverty and migration affect the use of prophylactic measures against pathogen transmission and infection as well as increasing the zoonotic risk to introducing pathogens by infected humans. Small animal associated factors such as pet trade and pet travel spread infection and certain vectors such as ticks and fleas. All these factors pose several complex and significant challenges for veterinarians in clinical practice to decide on efficient laboratory work-up and constructive diagnostic procedures.","[Leschnik, Michael] Vet Univ Vienna, Small Anim Clin, Vet Pl 1, A-1210 Vienna, Austria","Leschnik, M (corresponding author), Vet Univ Vienna, Small Anim Clin, Vet Pl 1, A-1210 Vienna, Austria.",michael.leschnik@vetmeduni.ac.at,,,,,,104,0,0,7,7,SCIENDO,WARSAW,"BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A, WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND",0567-8315,1820-7448,,ACTA VET-BEOGRAD,Acta Vet.-Beogr.,JUN,2020,70,2,,,,,147,169,,10.2478/acve-2020-0011,,,23,Veterinary Sciences,Veterinary Sciences,LY9LP,WOS:000540849900001,,DOAJ Gold,,,2020-12-20,

To characterize immune responses to ZIKV, here we examine transcriptional signatures of CD4 T, CD8 T, B, and NK cells, monocytes, myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs), and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) from three individuals with ZIKV infection. While gene expression patterns from most cell subsets display signs of impaired antiviral immune activity, pDCs from infected host have distinct transcriptional response associated with activation of innate immune recognition and type I interferon signaling pathways, but downregulation of key host factors known to support ZIKV replication steps; meanwhile, pDCs exhibit a unique expression pattern of gene modules that are correlated with alternative cell populations, suggesting collaborative interactions between pDCs and other immune cells, particularly B cells. Together, these results point towards a discrete but integrative function of pDCs in the human immune responses to ZIKV infection. Zika virus (ZIKV) poses a significant public health threat, but the immune landscape changes following ZIKV infection is still unclear. Here, the authors show, using flow cytometry and transcriptomic data, that ZIKV induces a multitude of immune responses, with plasmacytoid dendritic cells poised centrally to interact with other immune cell types.","[Sun, Xiaoming; Hua, Stephane; Gao, Ce; Blackmer, Jane E.; Ouyang, Zhengyu; Lichterfeld, Mathias; Yu, Xu G.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ragon Inst MGH MIT & Harvard, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Ard, Kevin; Ciaranello, Andrea; Rosenberg, Eric S.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Infect Dis Div, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Yawetz, Sigal; Sax, Paul E.; Lichterfeld, Mathias; Yu, Xu G.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Infect Dis Div, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Yu, XG (corresponding author), Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ragon Inst MGH MIT & Harvard, Boston, MA 02114 USA.; Yu, XG (corresponding author), Brigham & Womens Hosp, Infect Dis Div, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",xyu@mgh.harvard.edu,,,"NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [AI078799, AI089339, HL121890, AI098484, HL126554, AI116228, AI087452]; Sundry fund from the Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard","X.G.Y. is supported by NIH (grants AI078799, AI089339, HL121890, AI098484, HL126554, AI116228, and AI087452) and by a Sundry fund from the Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard.",,69,2,2,0,0,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2041-1723,,,NAT COMMUN,Nat.

The species in this subgenus are strongly associated with humid forests rich in epiphytic bromeliads. Forest fragmentation and anthropogenic changes can therefore have a negative impact on the abundance and survival of these mosquito species. Within this subgenus, four species are considered primary vectors of malaria: An. cruzii, An. bellator, An. homunculus and An. neivai. Malaria cases associated with Kerteszia species are often referred to as bromeliad malaria, a type of malaria reported to be endemic in the coastal rainforest of the neotropical region since the end of the nineteenth century. Although the incidence of bromeliad-malaria cases has decreased since the middle of the last century, autochthonous malaria cases continue to be registered every year. The complexity of the epidemiology of bromeliad malaria appears to be increasing as asymptomatic plasmodial infections and transmission of simian Plasmodium to humans have recently been reported. Kerteszia vector species have a great affinity for human beings and can be found in human-modified areas close to forest fragments such as in the Extra-Amazonian region of Brazil, Colombian pacific coast, and the Caribbean coast. Deforestation and forest fragmentation have been occurring continuously in the biomes of the neotropical region, and findings of Kerteszia species in dwellings are frequent in this region. Controlling the species in the Kerteszia subgenus is particularly difficult because they move frequently from natural to rural and peri-urban areas in search of blood sources, posing a challenge for the development of control strategies based on integrated vector management. Furthermore, as it has been shown that some Kerteszia species share similar morphological and genetic characteristics, the existence of a species complex formed by cryptic, sibling species within the Kerteszia group in different areas in the South and Southeast of Brazil cannot be ruled out. The existence of such a complex could represent an obstacle to the control of Kerteszia species and consequently to the elimination of bromeliad-malaria transmission in these regions. Here, we review publications that focus on the biology and ecology of Kerteszia malaria vectors and their association with human-modified areas and bromeliad-malaria transmission.","[Multini, Laura Cristina; Marrelli, Mauro Toledo] Univ Sao Paulo, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Av Dr Arnaldo 715, BR-01246904 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Wilke, Andre Barretto Bruno] Univ Miami, Miller Sch Med, Dept Publ Hlth Sci, Miami, FL 33136 USA","Multini, LC (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Av Dr Arnaldo 715, BR-01246904 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.",lauramultini@usp.br,"Wilke, Andre B B/J-9973-2014","Wilke, Andre B B/0000-0002-6629-7666",Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2015/23386-7],"The authors would like to thank the Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) for providing financial support for the Medical Entomology Laboratory at the School of Public Health, University of Sao Paulo.

One crucial metric is vectorial capacity (VC), a simple equation describing the potential of mosquitoes to transmit pathogens. Despite its elegance, this formula lacks specificity to describe mosquitoes in a particular landscape. To study how these metrics arise in particular places, we built MBITES (Mosquito Bout-based and Individual-based Transmission Ecology Simulator), a complex stochastic individual-based model where mosquitoes fly from place to place to blood feed, sugar feed, lay eggs, mate, or rest. We also built a related model, MBDETES based on deterministic mathematics to show how the complex behaviors possible in MBITES can be summarized on average, and to provide a bridge to the simple equations describing VC. Through a series of computational experiments, we show a strong dependence VC and other metrics on fine details of the landscape mosquitoes inhabit which are not obvious from simple equations. Mosquitoes are important vectors for pathogens that infect humans and other vertebrate animals. Some aspects of adult mosquito behavior and mosquito ecology play an important role in determining the capacity of vector populations to transmit pathogens. Here, we re-examine factors affecting the transmission of pathogens by mosquitoes using a new approach. Unlike most previous models, this framework considers the behavioral states and state transitions of adult mosquitoes through a sequence of activity bouts. We developed a new framework for individual-based simulation models called MBITES (Mosquito Bout-based and Individual-based Transmission Ecology Simulator). In MBITES, it is possible to build models that simulate the behavior and ecology of adult mosquitoes in exquisite detail on complex resource landscapes generated by spatial point processes. We also developed an ordinary differential equation model which is the Kolmogorov forward equations for models developed in MBITES under a specific set of simplifying assumptions. While mosquito infection and pathogen development are one possible part of a mosquito's state, that is not our main focus. Using extensive simulation using some models developed in MBITES, we show that vectorial capacity can be understood as an emergent property of simple behavioral algorithms interacting with complex resource landscapes, and that relative density or sparsity of resources and the need to search can have profound consequences for mosquito populations' capacity to transmit pathogens.","[Wu, Sean L.; Sanchez C, Hector M.; Liang, Biyonka; Marshall, John M.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Div Biostat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Wu, Sean L.; Sanchez C, Hector M.; Liang, Biyonka; Marshall, John M.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Div Epidemiol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Sanchez C, Hector M.] Inst Tecnol & Estudios Super Monterrey, Monterrey, Mexico; [Henry, John M.; Citron, Daniel T.; Zhang, Qian; Compton, Kelly; Reiner, Robert C., Jr.; Smith, David L.] Univ Washington, Inst Hlth Metr & Evaluat, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Verma, Amit] Emory Univ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Cummings, Derek A.

In this region, recent studies showed asymptomatic or sub-patent Plasmodium falciparum infection. In areas of the Atlantic coast in Rio de Janeiro, Plasmodium simium infection was recently reported in both human and howler monkey. Considering that (1) few malaria cases are reported each year in areas across the tropical Atlantic rain forest in southeastern Brazil; (2) malaria elimination in Atlantic forest is challenged by circulation of P. falciparum and P. simium in humans; (3) the complexity of malaria epidemiology in this region; and (4) the public health importance of Kerteszia cruzii as a sylvatic vector; the major goal of this study is to evaluate Plasmodium infection in Ke. cruzii. Mosquito sampling collections were conducted in Esteiro do Morro and Sitio Itapuan, in Cananeia municipality, and Tapirai municipality in Ribeira Valley, southeastern Sao Paulo state, Brazil. Influence of climate and landscape factors in Plasmodium infection in Ke. cruzii was addressed. Among the 1719 mosquitoes tested, 3 females collected in Sitio Itapuan and three from Tapirai were found infected with either P. vivax or P. simium. Results of statistical analyses did not demonstrate association between Plasmodium infection in mosquito and the landscape. Mosquito infection was found in two landscape clusters, with Plasmodium detected in forest fringe mosquitoes. This finding shows that Ke. cruzii can facilitate transmission among human and non-human primates. Plasmodium falciparum was not identified in the samples analyzed. Spatiotemporal variation in local malaria incidence, low prevalence of Plasmodium, variations in humidity and temperature can explain the absence of mosquitoes infected with P. falciparum in the study.","[Demari-Silva, B.; Oliveira, T.

Despite high rates of urbanization and ample examples of vector-borne diseases transmitted by multiple species, the effects of urbanization-driven mosquito diversity losses on disease transmission has not been well explored. We investigated this question using the dog heartworm, a filarial parasite vectored by numerous mosquito species. Methods We trapped host-seeking mosquitoes in undeveloped areas and neighborhoods of different ages in Wake County, North Carolina, USA, analyzing captured mosquitoes for heartworm DNA. We compared within-mosquito heartworm infection across land-use types by Kruskal-Wallis and likelihood ratio tests. Using zip code level data acquired from dogs in a local shelter, we performed linear regressions of within-host heartworm prevalence by within-mosquito heartworm prevalence as well as by three mosquito diversity measures. We also determined the best predictor of host-level prevalence among models including within-mosquito infection, mosquito diversity and abundance, and socioeconomic status as variables. Results Suburban areas had lower within-mosquito heartworm prevalence and lower likelihood of heartworm-positive mosquitoes than did undeveloped field sites, although no differences were seen between suburban and undeveloped wooded sites. No relationships were noted between within-mosquito and within-host heartworm prevalence. However, mosquito diversity metrics were positively correlated with host heartworm prevalence. Model selection revealed within-host prevalence was best predicted by a positive relationship with mosquito Shannon-Wiener diversity and a negative relationship with household income. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that decreases in mosquito diversity due to urbanization alter vector-borne disease risk. With regard to dog heartworm disease, this loss of mosquito diversity is associated with decreased heartworm prevalence within both the vector and the host. Although the response is likely different for diseases transmitted by one or few species, mosquito diversity losses leading to decreased transmission could be generalizable to other pathogens with multiple vectors. This study contributes to better understanding of the effects of urbanization and the role of vector diversity in multi-vectored pathosystems.","[Spence Beaulieu, Meredith R.; Reiskind, Michael H.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Entomol & Plant Pathol, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Federico, Jennifer L.] Wake Cty Anim Ctr, Anim Serv Div, Dept Environm Serv, Raleigh, NC USA","Reiskind, MH (corresponding author), North Carolina State Univ, Dept Entomol & Plant Pathol, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",mhreiski@ncsu.edu,,"Reiskind, Michael/0000-0001-7307-9416","National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship ProgramNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DGE-1746939]; USDA Multistate Hatch Project [MS-1443/1943, NC-2630]","This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program under Grant No. DGE-1746939.

We determined the abundance of three LACV accessory vectors (Aedes albopictus, Ae. canadensis, and Ae. vexans) and the primary amplifying host (Eastern chipmunk; Tamias striatus), and tested for LACV prevalence in both vectors and chipmunks, across a gradient of experimental forest disturbance treatments in southwest Virginia. Forest disturbance significantly affected the abundance of LACV accessory vectors, with a higher abundance on disturbed sites for Ae. canadensis and Ae. vexans. However, there was no significant disturbance effect on chipmunk abundance. Forest disturbance significantly affected LACV prevalence in mosquito vectors, with most (80%) detections on unlogged control sites, which past work showed harbor the highest abundance of the two most common LACV vectors (the primary vector Aedes triseriatus, and Ae. japonicus). Interestingly, LACV nucleic acid was only detected in Ae. japonicus and Culex pipiens/restuans, with no detections in the primary vector, Ae. triseriatus. In contrast to the vector results, antibodies were only found in chipmunks on logged sites, but this result was not statistically significant. Overall, our results suggest that human LACV risk should generally decline with logging, and reveal the potential importance of accessory vectors in LACV maintenance in Appalachian forests.","[Hopkins, M.

Whether deforestation directly or indirectly affects the prevalence of avian haemosporidian parasites through their hosts and/or vectors is still not well understood. We sampled understory bird communities (insectivorous, frugivorous, granivorous and nectarivorous birds) and mosquitoes in three habitats showing a gradient of deforestation (pristine forest, fragmented forest, and young palm oil plantation), to assess the effects of habitat changes on avian haemosporidian (Plasmodium and Haemoproteus) prevalence and its relationship to bird feeding guilds and mosquito abundance. Blood samples of 845 individual birds belonging to 85 species and 27 families were collected in the three habitat types and screened using microscopy and PCR. Plasmodium infections were detected in 136 individuals (16.09%) and varied significantly among habitat types while Haemoproteus infections were detected in 98 individuals (11.60%) and did not vary significantly among habitat types. However, the prevalence of Plasmodium and Haemoproteus in bird feeding groups varied significantly among habitats. Nectarivorous and granivorous birds had the highest Plasmodium and Haemoproteus prevalence, respectively. The abundance of mosquitoes varied significantly among habitat types and the prevalence of Plasmodium significantly and positively correlated with mosquito abundance in fragmented forest. This study highlights the importance of host and mosquito determinants in the transmission dynamics of avian Plasmodium and Haemoproteus infections following habitat changes. Selective logging favored an increase in the prevalence of Plasmodium in insectivores, the prevalence of Haemoproteus in nectarivores and the abundance of female mosquitoes while, the establishment of the palm oil plantation favored an increase in the prevalence of Plasmodium in granivores and Haemoproteus in nectarivores. Species feeding behavior is also an important determinant to consider for a better understanding of patterns of parasite infections in a changing environment.

Following ingestion of an infected blood meal, DENV enters the mosquito midgut epithelial cells, where it replicates. Subsequently, the virus disseminates and infects other tissues, including hemocytes, fat body and reproductive organs, ultimately reaching the salivary glands. The kinetics of infection are influenced by genetic variation in the virus. Comparisons between strains within single serotypes, have revealed variation in infection rates in mosquitoes. To explore the role of infectious dose, serotype and tissue in viral infection kinetics we sampled DENV loads in populations of infected mosquitoes over numerous, sequential time-points. We reveal that the kinetics of DENV infection in the midgut, carcass and salivary glands of the mosquito Aedes aegypti are strikingly different among the strains selected for this study, and that these differences are also driven by the initial infectious dose. Dengue virus (DENV) transmission by mosquitoes is a time-dependent process that begins with the consumption of an infectious blood-meal. DENV infection then proceeds stepwise through the mosquito from the midgut to the carcass, and ultimately to the salivary glands, where it is secreted into saliva and then transmitted anew on a subsequent bite. We examined viral kinetics in tissues of the Aedes aegypti mosquito over a finely graded time course, and as per previous studies, found that initial viral dose and serotype strain diversity control infectivity. We also found that a threshold level of virus is required to establish body-wide infections and that replication kinetics in the early and intermediate tissues do not predict those of the salivary glands. Our findings have implications for mosquito GMO design, modeling the contribution of transmission to vector competence and the role of mosquito kinetics in the overall DENV epidemiological landscape.","[Novelo, Mario; Hall, Matthew D.; McGraw, Elizabeth A.] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Novelo, Mario; McGraw, Elizabeth A.] Penn State Univ, Ctr Infect Dis Dynam, Dept Entomol, Huck Inst Life Sci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Pak, Damie] Penn State Univ, Dept Biol, Ctr Infect Dis Dynam, Huck Inst Life Sci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Young, Paul R.] Univ Queensland, Sch Chem & Mol Biosci, Australian Infect Dis Res Ctr, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Holmes, Edward C.] Univ Sydney, Marie Bashir Inst Infect Dis & Biosecur, Charles Perkins Ctr, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Holmes, Edward C.] Univ Sydney, Sydney Med Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia","McGraw, EA (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.; McGraw, EA (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Ctr Infect Dis Dynam, Dept Entomol, Huck Inst Life Sci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",eam7@psu.edu,"Hall, Matthew/A-2006-2009; Young, Paul/A-6176-2010; McGraw, Elizabeth/A-6658-2012","Hall, Matthew/0000-0002-4738-203X; Young, Paul/0000-0002-2040-5190; Holmes, Edward/0000-0001-9596-3552; McGraw, Elizabeth/0000-0001-7973-088X; Pak, Damie/0000-0002-8335-110X",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP160100588]; Australian Research Council Laureate FellowshipAustralian Research Council [FL170100022],"This study was funded by Australian Research Council to EAM and PRY (DP160100588).

Most recent severe outbreaks have occurred in Indian Ocean islands of Reunion and Mauritius and India. There is no specific drug treatment for the disease, neither is there a standardized vaccine available for prevention of the disease. The present review gives a global perspective on patents filed pertaining to chikungunya. The United States has been the top patent filing jurisdiction followed by China, Europe, and India. The patents have been classified into categories of therapeutics, diagnostics, and vaccines. Maximum patent documents fall under the therapeutics category, in which patent applications are predominantly related to chemically derived drugs. They include nucleic acid analogues, various other host and virus enzyme/protein inhibitors. Patents on biological or plant derived drugs are being filed relatively recently. In the category of diagnostics, immunoassay based tests seemed to be of choice until the year 2005, whereas, patent filings for molecular diagnostics have now surpassed those with immunoassay techniques. In the vaccines category, vaccines based on viral vectors appear to be emerging as the preferred vaccine platform with the majority of patents filed in the years 2014-2017. Corporate sector has the most patent filings to its credit, followed closely by academic institutions. Pasteur Institut along with Chinese Agency for Science, Technology and Research is the top patent filing entity in chikungunya related technology space. Presently, nine vaccine products, three antiviral drugs and one mRNA based gene therapy are under development. Three vaccine products have been given fast track designation by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to expedite review and facilitate the development of a vaccine to prevent a serious or life-threatening condition and fill an unmet medical need.

We collected 908,237 female mosquitoes in an area of 54,984 ha in the Donana National Park, southern Spain. We identified the mosquitoes and screened them for viruses, censused birds, characterized landscape and climatic variables, and then modeled the presence and infection rate of the virus in relation to host, vector, climatic, and landscape variables.

Our results suggest that Usutu prevalence may be higher when and where host (passerine) richness was high, and thus challenging the conventional idea that host biodiversity reduces flavivirus amplification.","[Roiz, David] IRD, Infect Dis & Vectors Ecol Genet Evolut & Control, IRD224, UMR,UM,CNRS5290, 911 Ave Agropolis, F-34394 Montpellier, France; [Roiz, David; Soriguer, Ramon; Figuerola, Jordi] CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, Av Amer Vespucio 26, Seville 41092, Spain; [Vazquez, Ana; Tenorio, Antonio] Inst Salud Carlos III, Ctr Nacl Microbiol, Lab Arbovirus & Enfermedades Vir Importadas, Madrid, Spain; [Ruiz, Santiago] Serv Control Mosquitos, Area Medio Ambiente, Diputac Huelva, Huelva, Spain; [Vazquez, Ana; Ruiz, Santiago; Soriguer, Ramon; Figuerola, Jordi] CIBERESP, Madrid, Spain","Roiz, D (corresponding author), IRD, Infect Dis & Vectors Ecol Genet Evolut & Control, IRD224, UMR,UM,CNRS5290, 911 Ave Agropolis, F-34394 Montpellier, France.; Roiz, D (corresponding author), CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, Av Amer Vespucio 26, Seville 41092, Spain.",davidroiz@gmail.com,"Vazquez, Ana/H-4911-2013; Figuerola, Jordi/B-7917-2008; Roiz, David/F-2082-2011; Soriguer, Ramon/J-1494-2014","Vazquez, Ana/0000-0002-9872-3316; Figuerola, Jordi/0000-0002-4664-9011; Roiz, David/0000-0002-5819-3648; Soriguer, Ramon/0000-0002-9165-7766",,,,42,2,2,2,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1612-9202,1612-9210,,ECOHEALTH,EcoHealth,DEC,2019,16,4,,,,,734,742,,10.1007/s10393-019-01441-3,,OCT 2019,9,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KH7QI,WOS:000491410900003,31628631,,,,2020-12-20,

Close-contact relationships at a landscape level can have broad implications for disease epidemiology. From 1995-1999, we captured and radio-collared 41 deer in two suburban forest preserves in Chicago, Illinois. We collected blood to determine if animals were seronegative or seropositive for Jamestown Canyon virus and tracked deer movements within suburban habitats. We developed utilization distributions at the population-level and evaluated resource selection for seronegative and seropositive deer. We used maximum likelihood estimation for model selection via Akaike information criterion and then restricted maximum likelihood estimation to attain unbiased estimates of the parameters in the top-ranking models. The top-ranking model describing the resource selection of seronegative deer received almost the full weight of evidence (Akaike information criterion omega(i)=0.93), and included the proportion of wetlands, precipitation in year t, and an interaction of the proportion of wetlands and precipitation in year t. The top-ranking model describing resource selection of seropositive deer received the full weight of evidence (Akaike information criterion omega(i)=1.00). The model included distance to nearest populated place, distance to nearest river, length of road in each grid cell, precipitation in year t, and an interaction of the length of road in each grid cell and precipitation in year t. These results are valuable for mapping the spatial configuration of hotspots for Jamestown Canyon virus and could be used to educate local residents and recreationalists to reduce human exposure.","[Hollis-Etter, Karmen M.] Univ Michigan, Biol Dept, Flint, MI 48503 USA; [Montgomery, Robert A.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Etter, Dwayne R.] Wildlife Div Michigan Dept Nat Resources, Lansing, MI USA; [Anchor, Christopher L.; Chelsvig, James E.] Forest Preserve Dist Cook Cty, River Forest, IL USA; [Warner, Richard E.] Univ Illinois Champaign Urbana, Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Urbana, IL USA; [Grimstad, Paul R.; Lovin, Diane D.] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Godsey, Marvin S., Jr.] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Div Vector Borne Dis, Ft Collins, CO USA","Hollis-Etter, KM (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Biol Dept, Flint, MI 48503 USA.",kahollis@umflint.edu,,,Cook County Animal Control,"Direct funding for the research was provided by Cook County Animal Control awarded to KHE, CLA, and REW.

This hypothesis is largely based on suspected higher rates of zoonotic disease spillover and emergence in fragmented landscapes and other areas where humans live in close vicinity to wildlife. For example, Ebola virus outbreaks have been linked to contacts between humans and infected wildlife at the rural-forest border, and spillover of yellow fever via mosquito vectors happens at the interface between forest and human settlements. Because spillover involves complex interactions between multiple species and is difficult to observe directly, empirical studies are scarce, particularly those that quantify underlying mechanisms. In this review, we identify and explore potential ecological mechanisms affecting spillover of pathogens (and parasites in general) at ecosystem boundaries. We borrow the concept of 'permeability' from animal movement ecology as a measure of the likelihood that hosts and parasites are present in an ecosystem boundary region. We then discuss how different mechanisms operating at the levels of organisms and ecosystems might affect permeability and spillover. This review is a step towards developing a general theory of cross-species parasite spillover across ecosystem boundaries with the eventual aim of improving predictions of spillover risk in heterogeneous landscapes.

To survive such hostile and shifting conditions, Plasmodium switches transcriptional programs during development and has evolved mechanisms to adjust its phenotype through heterogeneous patterns of gene expression. In vitro studies on culture-adapted isolates have served to set the link between chromatin structure and functional gene expression. Yet, experimental evidence is limited to certain stages of the parasite in the vertebrate, i.e. blood, while the precise mechanisms underlying the dynamic regulatory landscapes during development and in the adaptation to within-host conditions remain poorly understood. In this review, we discuss available data on transcriptional and epigenetic regulation in Plasmodium mosquito stages in the context of sporogonic development and phenotypic variation, including both bet-hedging and environmentally triggered direct transcriptional responses. With this, we advocate the mosquito offers an in vivo biological model to investigate the regulatory networks, transcription factors and chromatin-modifying enzymes and their modes of interaction with regulatory sequences, which might be responsible for the plasticity of the Plasmodium genome that dictates stage- and cell type-specific blueprints of gene expression.","[Ruiz, Jose L.; Gomez-Diaz, Elena] Spanish Natl Res Council, Inst Parasitol & Biomed Lopez Neyra, Madrid, Spain","Gomez-Diaz, E (corresponding author), CSIC, IPBLN, Granada 18016, Spain.",elena.gomez@csic.es,"Gomez-Diaz, Elena/AAA-9141-2019; Rodriguez, Jose Luis Ruiz/AAM-2823-2020","Gomez-Diaz, Elena/0000-0002-4146-9003; Rodriguez, Jose Luis Ruiz/0000-0003-1901-1888","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO)/Agencia Estatal de Investigacion (AEI) [BFU2015-65000-R]; 2017 Leonardo Grant for Researchers and Cultural Creators, BBVA FoundationBBVA Foundation; Severo Ochoa fellowship from MINECO [BES-2016-076276]; Ramon y Cajal grant from MINECO","This work was funded by Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO)/Agencia Estatal de Investigacion (AEI) grant to E.G.-D (BFU2015-65000-R).

Recent reports indicate that the levels of malaria-associated mortality and morbidity in SSA have remained the same. Malaria vectors have modified their feeding behavior in response to the selective pressure from indoor-based interventions, and there is emerging malaria parasite resistance to artemisinin-based combination therapies. These challenges have created an altered malaria landscape, especially within local scales in some malaria-endemic countries in SSA. To address these challenges, complementary new strategies are urgently required for malaria control. This paper argues that to develop the next generation of vector and chemotherapeutic tools for malaria control, especially based on natural products with novel modes of action, a better understanding of mosquito bioecology and, more importantly, plant sugar feeding is needed.

Here, we used high-hydrostatic-pressure nuclear magnetic resonance (HHP-NMR) to obtain residue-specific information on the folding process of domain III from serotype 4 dengue virus (DEN4-ED3), which adopts the classical three-dimensional (3D) ss-sandwich structure known as the Ig-like fold. Interestingly, the folding pathway of DEN4-ED3 shares similarities with that of the Titin I27 module, which also adopts an Ig-like fold, but is functionally unrelated to ED3. For both proteins, the unfolding process starts by the disruption of the N- and C-terminal strands on one edge of the ss-sandwich, yielding a folding intermediate stable over a substantial pressure range (from 600 to 1000 bar). In contrast to this similarity, pressure-jump kinetics indicated that the folding transition state is considerably more hydrated in DEN4-ED3 than in Titin I27.","[Saotome, Tomonori; Kulkarni, Manjiri; Kuroda, Yutaka] Tokyo Univ Agr & Technol, Dept Biotechnol & Life Sci, 2-24-16 Nakamachi, Koganei, Tokyo 1848588, Japan; [Doret, Maxime; Yang, Yin-Shan; Barthe, Philippe; Roumestand, Christian] Univ Montpellier, Ctr Biochim Struct, CNRS, UMR 5048,INSERM,U1054, 29 Rue Navacelles, F-34090 Montpellier, France","Roumestand, C (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier, Ctr Biochim Struct, CNRS, UMR 5048,INSERM,U1054, 29 Rue Navacelles, F-34090 Montpellier, France.",roume@cbs.cnrs.fr,"Kuroda, Yutaka/G-1094-2013; Saotome, Tomonori/Q-6466-2017","Kuroda, Yutaka/0000-0002-3221-4295; Barthe, Philippe/0000-0003-4282-6604; ROUMESTAND, Christian/0000-0002-4082-3293","Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [18H02385]; Institute of Global Innovative Research","This research was funded partly by the Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) research grant (KAKENHI-18H02385), and the Institute of Global Innovative Research (GIR, TUAT).",,42,2,2,0,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2218-273X,,BIOMOLECULES,Biomolecules,AUG,2019,9,8,,,,,,,309,10.3390/biom9080309,,,16,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,IV7OY,WOS:000484457600014,31357538,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2020-12-20,

Among the flaviviral proteins, the nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) is the largest, most conserved, and major enzymatic component of the viral replication complex. Disruption of the common key NS5-host protein-protein interactions critical for viral replication could aid in the development of broad-spectrum antiflaviviral therapeutics. Hundreds of NS5 interactors have been identified, but these are mostly DENV-NS5 interactors. To this end, we sought to investigate the JEV- and ZIKV-NS5 interactomes using EGFP immunoprecipitation with label-free quantitative mass spectrometry analysis. We report here a total of 137 NS5 interactors with a significant enrichment of spliceosomal and spliceosomal-associated proteins. The transcription complex Paf1C and phosphatase 6 were identified as common NS5-associated complexes. PAF1 was shown to play opposite roles in JEV and ZIKV infections. Additionally, we validated several NS5 targets and proposed their possible roles in infection. These include lipid-shuttling proteins OSBPL9 and OSBPL11, component of RNAP3 transcription factor TFIIIC, minichromosome maintenance, and cochaperone PAQosome.

Wolbachia infections inhibit viral transmission by the mosquito, and can spread between mosquito hosts to reach high frequencies in the vector population. Wolbachia spreads by maternal transmission, and spread dynamics can be variable and highly dependent on natural mosquito population dynamics, population structure and fitness components. We develop a mathematical model of an A. aegypti metapopulation that incorporates empirically validated relationships describing density-dependent mosquito fitness components. We assume that density dependent relationships differ across subpopulations, and construct heterogeneous landscapes for which model-predicted patterns of variation in mosquito abundance and demography approximate those observed in field populations. We then simulate Wolbachia release strategies similar to that used in field trials. We show that our model can produce rates of spatial spread of Wolbachia similar to those observed following field releases. We then investigate how different types of spatio-temporal variation in mosquito habitat, as well as different fitness costs incurred by Wolbachia on the mosquito host, influence predicted spread rates. We find that fitness costs reduce spread rates more strongly when the habitat landscape varies temporally due to stochastic and seasonal processes. Synthesis and applications: Our empirically based modelling approach represents effects of environmental heterogeneity on the spatial spread of Wolbachia. The models can assist in interpreting observed spread patterns following field releases and in designing suitable release strategies for targeting spatially heterogeneous vector populations.","[Hancock, Penelope A.; Godfray, H.

Results We collected 168 405 adult haematophagous dipterans in total, including 26 genera and 86 species. Pristine forest settings were always more taxonomically diverse than the disturbed forest sites, confirming that disturbance has a negative impact on species richness. Species of Phlebotominae and Culicoides were mainly classified as climax (i.e. forest specialist) or disturbance-generalist, which tend to decrease in abundance along with rising levels of disturbance. In contrast, a significant portion of mosquito species, including primary and secondary disease vectors, was classified as colonists (i.e. disturbed-areas specialists), which tend to increase in numbers towards more disturbed forest habitats. At pristine forest, the most prevalent species of Phlebotominae and Culicoides partitioned the vertical niche by being active at the forest canopy or in the understorey; yet this pattern was less clear in disturbed habitats. Most mosquito species were not vertically stratified in their habitat preference. Conclusion We posit that entomological risk and related pathogen exposure to humans is higher in pristine forest scenarios for Culicoides and Phlebotominae transmitted diseases, whereas forest disturbance poses a higher entomological risk for mosquito-borne infections. This suggests that the Dilution Effect Hypothesis (DEH) does not apply in tropical rainforests where highly abundant, yet unrecognised insect vectors and neglected zoonotic diseases occur. Comprehensive, community level entomological surveillance is, therefore, the key for predicting potential disease spill over in scenarios of pristine forest intermixed with anthropogenic habitats. We suggest that changes in forest quality should also be considered when assessing arthropod-borne disease transmission risk.","[Loaiza, Jose R.; Rovira, Jose R.; Dutari, Larissa] Inst Invest Cient & Serv Alta Tecnol, Panama City, Panama; [Loaiza, Jose R.; Sanjur, Oris, I] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa Ancon, Panama; [Loaiza, Jose R.; Zepeda, Jesus Altagracia] Univ Panama, Programa Centroamer Maestria Entomol, Panama City, Panama; [Pecor, James E.; Foley, Desmond H.] Museum Support Ctr, Smithsonian Inst, Walter Reed Biosystemat Unit, Suitland, MD USA; [Dutari, Larissa] Acharya Nagarjuna Univ, Dept Biotechnol, Guntur, India; [Radtke, Meghan; Pongsiri, Montira J.] US EPA, Washington, DC 20460 USA; [Molinar, Octavio Smith] Ctr Agua Trop Humedo Amer Latina & Caribe, Panama City, Panama; [Laporta, Gabriel Z.] Fundacao ABC, Setor Posgrad Pesquisa & Inovacao, Ctr Univ Saude ABC, Santo Andre, Brazil","Loaiza, JR (corresponding author), Inst Invest Cient & Serv Alta Tecnol, Panama City, Panama.; Laporta, GZ (corresponding author), Fundacao ABC, Setor Posgrad Pesquisa & Inovacao, Ctr Univ Saude ABC, Santo Andre, Brazil.",jloaiza@indicasat.org.pa; gabriel.laporta@fmabc.br,"Laporta, Gabriel/P-3621-2019","Laporta, Gabriel/0000-0001-7412-9390","Environmental Protection Agency - Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute research grant [DW33-92296801-0]; Secretariat for Science, Technology and Innovation of Panama (SENACYT) [GRID15-IP-002, IDDS15-047]; National System of Investigation (SNI); Sao Paulo Research Foundation BIOTA Fapesp Program (FAPESP)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2014/09774-1, 2015/09669- 6]","We are grateful to Oris Acevedo, Belkis Jimenez and Hilda Castaneda for logistical support at BCI; Eyda Gomez for helping managing the project logistics and for technical guidance; Mauricio Quintero, Anel J.

Particularly important in urban regions, where these species have evolved to breed in man-made containers and feed nearly exclusively on human hosts, the threat of vector-borne disease has risen in recent decades due to the growth of cities, progression of climate change, and increase in globalization. While the dynamics of Aedes populations in urban settings have been well studied in relation to ecological features of the landscape, relatively less is known about the relationship between neighborhood socioeconomic status and Aedes infestation. Here, we compare infestation levels of both A. aegypti and A. albopictus in four socioeconomically contrasting neighborhoods of urban Panama City, Panama. Our results indicate that infestation levels for both Aedes species vary between neighborhoods of contrasting socioeconomic status, being higher in neighborhoods having lower percentage of residents with bachelor degrees and lower monthly household income. Additionally, we find that proximity between socioeconomically contrasting neighborhoods can predict infestation levels by species, with A. aegypti increasing and A. albopictus decreasing with proximity between neighborhoods. These findings hold key implications for the control and prevention of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika in Panama, a region with ongoing arbovirus outbreaks and high economic inequity.","[Whiteman, Ari; Chen, Gang] Univ North Carolina Charlotte, Dept Geog & Earth Sci, 9201 Univ City Blvd, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA; [Whiteman, Ari; Rovira, Jose; McMillan, W.

Coupled human and natural systems (CHANS) research uses a multidisciplinary approach to identify the key actors, processes, and feedbacks that drive metapopulation and landscape dynamics. We describe a framework for modeling metapopulations in CHANS that integrates ecological and social data by coupling stochastic patch occupancy models of metapopulation dynamics with agent-based models of land-use change. We then apply this framework to metapopulations of the threatened black rail (Laterallus jamaicensis) and widespread Virginia rail (Rallus limicola) that inhabit patchy, irrigation-fed wetlands in the rangelands of the California Sierra Nevada foothills. We collected data from five diverse sources (rail occupancy surveys, land-use change mapping, a survey of landowner decision making, climate and reservoir databases, and mosquito trapping and West Nile virus testing) and integrated them into an agent-based stochastic patch occupancy model. We used the model to (1) quantify the drivers of metapopulation dynamics, and the potential interactions and feedbacks among them; (2) test predictions of the behavior of metapopulations in dynamic working landscapes; and (3) evaluate the impact of three policy options on metapopulation persistence (irrigation district water cutbacks during drought, incentives for landowners to create wetlands, and incentives for landowners to protect wetlands). Complex metapopulation dynamics emerged when landscapes functioned as CHANS, highlighting the importance of integrating human activities and other ecological processes into metapopulation models. Rail metapopulations were strongly top-down regulated by precipitation, and the black rail's decade-long decline was caused by the combination of West Nile virus and drought. Theoretical predictions of the two metapopulations' responses to dynamic landscapes and incentive programs were complicated by heterogeneity in patch quality and CHANS couplings, respectively. Irrigation cutbacks during drought posed a serious extinction risk that neither incentive policy effectively ameliorated.","[Van Schmidt, Nathan D.; Huntsinger, Lynn; Hruska, Tracy; Beissinger, Steven R.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, 130 Mulford Hall 3114, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kovach, Tony; Kilpatrick, A.

Discovery of new antimalarial drugs with novel chemotypes or modes of action lie at the heart of these efforts. There is a particular interest in drug candidates that target stages of the malaria parasite lifecycle beyond the symptomatic asexual blood stages. This is especially important given the spectre of emerging drug resistance to all current frontline antimalarials. One approach gaining increased interest is the potential of designing novel drugs that target parasite passage from infected individual to feeding mosquito and back again. Action of such therapeutics is geared much more at the population level rather than just concerned with the infected individual. The search for novel drugs active against these stages has been helped by improvements to in vitro culture of transmission and pre-erythrocytic parasite lifecycle stages, robotic automation and high content imaging, methodologies that permit the high-throughput screening (HTS) of compound libraries for drug discovery. Here, we review recent advances in the antimalarial screening landscape, focussed on transmission blocking as a key aim for drug-treatment campaigns of the future.","[Yahiya, Sabrina; Baum, Jake] Imperial Coll London, Dept Life Sci, Sir Alexander Fleming Bldg,Exhibition Rd, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Rueda-Zubiaurre, Ainoa; Fuchter, Matthew J.] Imperial Coll London, Dept Chem, Mol Sci Res Hub, White City Campus,Wood Lane, London W12 OBZ, England; [Delves, Michael J.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Keppel St, London WC1E 7HT, England","Baum, J (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Dept Life Sci, Sir Alexander Fleming Bldg,Exhibition Rd, London SW7 2AZ, England.",jake.baum@imperial.ac.uk,,"Delves, Michael/0000-0001-8526-4782; Baum, Jake/0000-0002-0275-352X",Wellcome [100993/Z/13/Z]; Bill & Melinda Gates FoundationBill & Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1043501]; UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC); Alfonso Martin Escudero Foundation,We apologise to the numerous researchers in the field whose work we were unable to discuss given the limited scope of a single review.

Despite this well-accepted narrative, the underlying mechanisms driving this association remain unclear. We introduce a nuanced hypothesis, the 'coevolution effect'. The central concept is that the subdivision of host populations which occurs with habitat fragmentation causes localized coevolution of hosts, obligate parasites, and pathogens which act as 'coevolutionary engines' within each fragment, accelerating pathogen diversification, and increasing pathogen diversity across the landscape. When combined with a mechanism to exit a fragment (e.g., mosquitoes), pathogen variants will spill over into human communities. Through this combined ecoevolutionary approach we may be able to understand the fine-scale mechanisms that drive disease emergence in the Anthropocene.","[Zohdy, Sarah] Auburn Univ, Sch Forestry & Wildlife Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Zohdy, Sarah] Auburn Univ, Coll Vet Med, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Schwartz, Tonia S.; Oaks, Jamie R.] Auburn Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA","Zohdy, S (corresponding author), Auburn Univ, Sch Forestry & Wildlife Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.; Zohdy, S (corresponding author), Auburn Univ, Coll Vet Med, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",zohdy@auburn.edu,,"Zohdy, Sarah/0000-0001-5316-0567; Schwartz, Tonia/0000-0002-7712-2810",Auburn University; USDAUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Auburn University School of Forestry and Wildlife Sciences; Auburn University Department of Biological Science; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 1656004]; College of Veterinary Medicine,"This research is supported by the Auburn University Intramural Grants Program.

In endemic areas, behavioral aspects of anopheline vectors such as host preference, biting time and resting location post blood meal have a key impact on malaria transmission dynamics and vector control interventions. Nyssorhynchus darlingi presents a range of feeding and resting behaviors throughout its broad distribution.MethodsTo investigate the genetic diversity related to biting behavior, we collected host-seeking Ny. darlingi in two settlement types in Acre, Brazil: Granada (20-year-old, more established, better access by road, few malaria cases) and Remansinho (8-year-old, active logging, poor road access, high numbers malaria cases). Mosquitoes were classified by the location of collection (indoors or outdoors) and time (dusk or dawn).ResultsGenome-wide SNPs, used to assess the degree of genetic divergence and population structure, identified non-random distributions of individuals in the PCA for both location and time analyses. Although genetic diversity related to behavior was confirmed by non-model-based analyses and F-ST values, model-based STRUCTURE detected considerable admixture of these populations.ConclusionsTo our knowledge, this is the first study to detect genetic markers associated with biting behavior in Ny. darlingi. Additional ecological and genomic studies may help to understand the genetic basis of mosquito behavior and address appropriate surveillance and vector control.","[Campos, Melina; Alonso, Diego Peres; Martins Ribolla, Paulo Eduardo] Sao Paulo State Univ UNESP, Biotechnol Inst IBTEC, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Campos, Melina; Alonso, Diego Peres; Martins Ribolla, Paulo Eduardo] Sao Paulo State Univ UNESP, Biosci Inst Botucatu IBB, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Conn, Jan E.] SUNY Albany, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biomed Sci, Albany, NY USA; [Conn, Jan E.] New York State Dept Hlth, Wadsworth Ctr, Albany, NY USA; [Vinetz, Joseph M.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Med, Div Infect Dis, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Vinetz, Joseph M.] Univ Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Inst Med Trop Alexander von Humboldt, Dept Ciencias Celulares & Mol, Lab Invest & Desarrollo, Lima, Peru; [Emerson, Kevin J.] St Marys Coll Maryland, Dept Biol, St Marys City, MD 20686 USA","Ribolla, PEM (corresponding author), Sao Paulo State Univ UNESP, Biotechnol Inst IBTEC, Sao Paulo, Brazil.; Ribolla, PEM (corresponding author), Sao Paulo State Univ UNESP, Biosci Inst Botucatu IBB, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",campos.m@imperial.ac.uk; p.ribolla@unesp.br,"Ribolla, Paulo/AAH-3354-2020; Alonso, Diego P/C-1079-2012; Emerson, Kevin/AAC-8207-2020","Emerson, Kevin/0000-0003-3283-0693; Conn, Jan/0000-0002-5301-7020","Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP); National Institutes of Health, USA, International Centers for Excellence in Malaria Research [U19AI089681]; St. Mary's College of Maryland; Conselho Nacional de Pesquisa (CNPq) fellowship; National Institutes of Health, USAUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01 AI110112]; NATIONAL CENTER FOR ADVANCING TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) [UL1TR001863, UL1TR001863, UL1TR001863, UL1TR001863, UL1TR001863, UL1TR001863, UL1TR001863, UL1TR001863] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [U19AI089681, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, R01AI110112, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, R01AI110112, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, R01AI110112, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, U19AI089681] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","MC was supported by Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP).

Larval source management could be a useful supplementary intervention, but to determine its feasibility, more detailed studies on the larval ecology of Ny. darlingi are essential. We conducted a multi-level study of the larval ecology of Anophelinae mosquitoes in the peri-Iquitos region of Amazonian Peru, examining the environmental characteristics of the larval habitats of four species, comparing the larval microbiota among species and habitats, and placing Ny. darlingi larval habitats in the context of spatial heterogeneity in human malaria transmission. We collected Ny. darlingi, Nyssorhynchus rangeli (formerly Anopheles rangeli), Nyssorhynchus triannulatus s.l. (formerly Anopheles triannulatus s.l.), and Nyssorhynchus sp. nr. konderi (formerly Anopheles sp. nr. konderi) from natural and artificial water bodies throughout the rainy and dry seasons. We found that, consistent with previous studies in this region and in Brazil, the presence of Ny. darlingi was significantly associated with water bodies in landscapes with more recent deforestation and lower light intensity. Nyssorhynchus darlingi presence was also significantly associated with a lower vegetation index, other Anophelinae species, and emergent vegetation. Though they were collected in the same water bodies, the microbial communities of Ny. darlingi larvae were distinct from those of Ny. rangeli and Ny. triannulatus s.l., providing evidence either for a species-specific larval microbiome or for segregation of these species in distinct microhabitats within each water body. We demonstrated that houses with more reported malaria cases were located closer to Ny. darlingi larval habitats; thus, targeted control of these sites could help ameliorate malaria risk. The co-occurrence of Ny. darlingi larvae in water bodies with other putative malaria vectors increases the potential impact of larval source management in this region. Author summary The standard methods used to combat mosquitoes that transmit malaria, long-lasting insecticide treated nets and indoor residual spraying, target mosquitoes that bite people indoors and rest indoors after biting. In Amazonian Peru, the major malaria vector, Nyssorhynchus darlingi (formerly Anopheles darlingi), is known to bite and rest mostly outdoors and to feed on animals as well as humans. Therefore, additional methods are needed to control this species, such as targeting immature mosquitoes in water bodies using chemical or biological larvicides or environmental modification. To determine whether this is feasible, more ecological information about Ny. darlingi larval habitats in this region is needed. In this study, we found that Ny. darlingi were more likely to be collected from water bodies in more deforested areas, and in the presence of other species of mosquitoes that transmit malaria. We characterized the bacteria detected in three species of mosquito larvae, and found that the species of mosquito, and not the water body, determined which bacteria were identified. As we found that houses with more malaria cases were located closer to Ny. darlingi larval habitats, management of larval habitats may be an effective method to reduce the risk of malaria in this region.","[Prussing, Catharine; Conn, Jan E.] SUNY Albany, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biomed Sci, Albany, NY 12144 USA; [Saavedra, Marlon P.; Guzman, Mitchel; Manrique, Edgar; Carrasco-Escobar, Gabriel; Gamboa, Dionicia; Vinetz, Joseph M.] Univ Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Lab ICEMR Amazonia, Lab Invest & Desarrollo, Fac Ciencias & Filosofia, Lima, Peru; [Bickersmith, Sara A.; Conn, Jan E.] New York State Dept Hlth, Wadsworth Ctr, Albany, NY 12201 USA; [Alava, Freddy] Minist Hlth, Iquitos, Peru; [Carrasco-Escobar, Gabriel] Univ Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Fac Salud Publ, Lima, Peru; [Moreno, Marta; Vinetz, Joseph M.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Med, Div Infect Dis, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Gamboa, Dionicia] Univ Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Dept Ciencias Celulares & Mol, Fac Ciencias & Filosofia, Lima, Peru; [Gamboa, Dionicia] Univ Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Inst Med Trop Alexander von Humboldt, Lima, Peru; [Moreno, Marta] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Infect Biol, London, England; [Vinetz, Joseph M.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Sect Infect Dis, New Haven, CT USA","Prussing, C; Conn, JE (corresponding author), SUNY Albany, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biomed Sci, Albany, NY 12144 USA.; Conn, JE (corresponding author), New York State Dept Hlth, Wadsworth Ctr, Albany, NY 12201 USA.",cprussing@albany.edu; jan.conn@health.ny.gov,"Prussing, Catharine/AAB-4546-2019; Moreno, Marta/AAW-8848-2020","Prussing, Catharine/0000-0001-6425-6839; Moreno, Marta/0000-0002-9091-5612; Conn, Jan/0000-0002-5301-7020; Bickersmith, Sara/0000-0002-2748-0425; Carrasco-Escobar, Gabriel/0000-0002-6945-0419; Manrique, Edgar/0000-0002-0196-0818; Guzman-Guzman, Mitchel/0000-0003-2662-2142; ALAVA AREVALO, FREDDY FRANCO/0000-0002-1402-2556","National Institutes of Health-National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIH-NIAID)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [U19AI089681]; NIH-NIAIDUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R01AI110112]; WHO TDRWorld Health Organization [201460655]; Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Disease training fellowship [T32AI05532901]; NATIONAL CENTER FOR ADVANCING TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) [UL1TR001863, UL1TR001863, UL1TR001863, UL1TR001863, UL1TR001863, UL1TR001863] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [U19AI089681, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, R01AI110112, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, R01AI110112, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, R01AI110112, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, U19AI089681] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This study was funded by National Institutes of Health-National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIH-NIAID) U19AI089681 to JMV (https://www.niaid.nih.gov); NIH-NIAID R01AI110112 to JEC, and WHO TDR Contract 201460655 to DG (https://www.who.int/tdr/en/).The Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Disease training fellowship grant T32AI05532901 provided partial support for CP.

Community-level changes after anthropogenic land-use change have been studied in a variety of organisms, but the effects on arthropods of medical and veterinary importance remain poorly characterized. Shifts in diversity, abundance, and community composition of such arthropods, like mosquitoes, can significantly impact vector-borne disease dynamics due to varying vectorial capacity between different species. In light of these potential implications for vector-borne diseases, we investigated changes in mosquito species assemblage after suburbanization by sampling mosquitoes in neighborhoods of different ages in Wake County, North Carolina, US. We found that independent of housing density and socioeconomic status, mosquito diversity measures decreased as suburban neighborhoods aged. In the oldest neighborhoods, the mosquito assemblage reached a distinct suburban climax community dominated by the invasive, peridomestic container-breeding Aedes albopictus, the Asian tiger mosquito. Aedes albopictus is a competent vector of many pathogens of human concern, and its dominance in suburban areas places it in close proximity with humans, allowing for heightened potential of host-vector interactions. While further research is necessary to explicitly characterize the effects of mosquito community simplification on vector-borne disease transmission in highly suburbanized areas, the current study demonstrates that suburbanization is disrupting mosquito communities so severely that they do not recover their diversity even 100 years after the initial disturbance. Our understanding of the community-level effects of anthropogenic land-use change on arthropod vectors will become increasingly important as we look to mitigate disease spread in a global landscape that is continually developed and altered by humans.","[Beaulieu, Meredith R.

This species is usually abundant in the forests where it occurs, preferring to live and feed on canopies, behaviour known as acrodendrophily. However, in several studies and locations this species has been observed in high density near the ground in the forest. In this study, it was hypothesized that factors associated with anthropogenic landscape changes may be responsible for the variation in abundance and acrodendrophily observed in An. cruzii.MethodsThe study was conducted in a conservation unit in the city of SAo Paulo, Brazil. Monthly entomological collections were performed from March 2015 to April 2017, and the resulting data were used with data from another study conducted in the same area between May 2009 and June 2010. Mosquitoes were collected from five sites using CDC and Shannon traps. Landscape composition and configuration metrics were measured, and generalized linear mixed-effect models were used to investigate the relationship between these metrics and variations in the abundance and acrodendrophily of An. cruzii.ResultsThe model that showed the best fit for the relationship between landscape metrics and An. cruzii abundance suggests that an increase in the proportion of forest cover leads to an increase in the abundance of this mosquito, while the model that best explained variations in An. cruzii acrodendrophily suggests that an increase in total forest-edge length leads to greater activity by this species at ground level.ConclusionWhile the data indicate that changes in landscape due to human activities lead to a reduction in An. cruzii abundance, such changes may increase the contact rate between this species and humans living on the edges of forest fragments where An. cruzii is found. Future studies should, therefore, seek to elucidate the effect of these landscape changes on the dynamics of Plasmodium transmission in the Atlantic Forest, which according to some studies includes the participation of simian hosts.","[Medeiros-Sousa, Antonio Ralph; Ceretti-Junior, Walter; Marrelli, Mauro Toledo] Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Publ Hlth, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Christe, Rafael de Oliveira] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Trop Med, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Ribeiro de Castro Duarte, Ana Maria; Mucci, Luis Filipe] State Dept Hlth, Superintendency Control Endem Dis SUCEN, Sao Paulo, Brazil","Medeiros-Sousa, AR (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Publ Hlth, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",aralphms@usp.br,"Mucci, Luis F/M-9130-2013; de Sousa, Antonio Ralph Medeiros/X-5615-2019; Junior, Walter Ceretti/F-7916-2014","Mucci, Luis F/0000-0002-7766-7597; de Sousa, Antonio Ralph Medeiros/0000-0002-9493-8731; Duarte, Ana Maria Ribeiro de Castro/0000-0001-8386-2762",Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2015/18630-6],This work was funded by the Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) Grants Nos. 2014/50444-5 and 2014/10919-4.

In some urban areas, this expansion has resulted in this invasive species being elevated as an important vector of dengue virus. Ornamental plants are often a feature of the urban landscape that may provide harborage for mosquitoes. Because adult mosquitoes require carbohydrates for subsistence, landscape vegetation may provide natural sugar sources to meet those needs. The aim of our study was to determine whether feeding on different ornamental plants from urban areas affects the survivorship and fecundity of Ae. albopictus. Newly emerged mosquitoes were given access to 11 ornamental plant species (6 flowering, 5 nonflowering) as sugar sources under laboratory conditions. Generally, survivorship was greater significantly when mosquitoes fed upon the ornamentals compared with those that were offered only water, whereas survivorship was shortened when individuals fed only on sucrose (P < 0.05). Mosquitoes that fed on nonflowering plants laid fewer eggs compared with those exposed to flowering plants. No significant difference was observed in egg hatch from females feeding on any of the plant species. Our findings provide insight into the potential influence that urban ornamental plants may have on the ecology of adult Ae. albopictus. The results of this study provide new avenues for integrated mosquito management in urban landscaped areas by planting ornamental plant species that contribute to lower survivorship and fecundity of peridomestically produced mosquitoes.","[Tian, Jiaxin; Mao, Guofeng; Fouad, Hatem; Wang, Chengpan; Ga'al, Hassan; Mo, Jianchu] Zhejiang Univ, Minist Agr, Key Lab Mol Biol Crop Pathogens & Insect Pests, Inst Insect Sci,Coll Agr Biotechnol, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Yu, Baoting] Natl Termite Control Ctr China, Hangzhou 310011, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Fouad, Hatem] Agr Res Ctr, Dept Field Crop Pests, Plant Protect Res Inst, Cairo, Egypt","Mo, JC (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Minist Agr, Key Lab Mol Biol Crop Pathogens & Insect Pests, Inst Insect Sci,Coll Agr Biotechnol, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",tianjiaxin@zju.edu.cn; maoguofeng@zju.edu.cn; yubaoting123@126.com; hatem1100@yahoo.com; wangcpwcp@163.com; xasan239@hotmail.com; mojianchu@zju.edu.cn,"Fouad, Hassan/U-3096-2019","Fouad, Hassan/0000-0001-9266-0628",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [81271873],We would like to thank C.

Small RNA (sRNA) silencing pathways are the main antiviral defence mechanism for arthropods, which lack adaptive immunity. Non-retroviral integrated RNA virus sequences (NIRVS) are one potential source of sRNAs which comprise these pathways. NIRVS are remnants of past germline RNA viral infections, where viral cDNA integrates into the host genome and is vertically transmitted. In Aedes mosquitoes, NIRVS are widespread and produce PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). These are hypothesised to target incoming viral transcripts to modulate viral titre, perhaps rendering the organism a more efficient arbovirus vector. To explore the NIRVS landscape in alternative arbovirus vectors, we validated the NIRVS landscape in Aedes spp. and then identified novel NIRVS in six medically relevant arthropods and also in Drosophila melanogaster. We identified novel NIRVS in Phlebotomus papatasi, Culicoides sonorensis, Rhipicephalus microplus, Anopheles gambiae, Culex quinquefasciatus, and Ixodes scapularis. Due to their unexpected abundance, we further characterised NIRVS in the black-legged tick I. scapularis (n = 143). Interestingly, NIRVS are not enriched in R. microplus, another hard tick, suggesting this is an Ixodes-specific adaptation. I. scapularis NIRVS are enriched in bunya- and orthomyxo-like sequences, reflecting that ticks are a dominant host for these virus groups. Unlike inmosquitoes, I. scapularis NIRVS are more commonly derived from the nonstructural region (replicase) of negative-sense viruses, as opposed to structural regions (e.g. glycoprotein). Like other arthropods, I. scapularis NIRVS preferentially integrate into genomic piRNA clusters, and serve as a template for primary piRNA production in the commonly used embryonic I. scapularis ISE6 cell line. Interestingly, we identified a two-fold enrichment of non-long terminal repeat (non-LTR) retrotransposons, in genomic proximity to NIRVS, contrasting with studeis in Ae. aegypti, where LTR retrotransposons are instead associated with NIRVS formation. We characterised NIRVS phylogeny and integration patterns in the important vector, I. scapularis, revealing they are distinct from those in Aedes spp. Future studies will explore the possible antiviral mechanism conferred by NIRVS to I. scapularis, which may help the transmission of pathogenic arboviruses. Finally, this study explored NIRVS as an untapped wealth of viral diversity in arthropods.","[Russo, Alice G.; Kelly, Andrew G.; Tuipulotu, Daniel Enosi; Tanaka, Mark M.; White, Peter A.] Univ New South Wales, Sch Biotechnol & Biomol Sci, Fac Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia","White, PA (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Sch Biotechnol & Biomol Sci, Fac Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",p.white@unsw.edu.au,"; White, Peter/C-6573-2012","Enosi Tuipulotu, Daniel/0000-0002-6442-4633; White, Peter/0000-0002-6046-9631","Faculty of Science, UNSW, Australia; Australian Government Research Training Program ScholarshipsAustralian Government","This research includes computations using the Linux computational cluster Katana supported by the Faculty of Science, UNSW, Australia.

In Amazonian Peru, the identification of the most productive, positive water bodies would increase the impact of targeted mosquito control on aquatic life stages. The present study explores the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) for identifying Nyssorhynchus darlingi (formerly Anopheles darlingi) breeding sites with high-resolution imagery ( 0.02m/pixel) and their multispectral profile in Amazonian Peru. Our results show that high-resolution multispectral imagery can discriminate a profile of water bodies where Ny. darlingi is most likely to breed (overall accuracy 86.73%- 96.98%) with a moderate differentiation of spectral bands. This work provides proof-of-concept of the use of high-resolution images to detect malaria vector breeding sites in Amazonian Peru and such innovative methodology could be crucial for LSM malaria integrated interventions. Author summary The most efficient malaria vector in the Latin American region is Nyssorhynchus darlingi (formerly Anopheles darlingi). In Amazonian Peru, where malaria is endemic, Ny. darlingi feeds both indoors and outdoors (endophagy, exophagy), depending on the local environment, and rests outdoors (exophily). LLINs and IRS, the most common tools employed for vector control, target endophagic and endophilic mosquitoes. Thus, they are only partially effective against Ny. darlingi. Control of the aquatic stages of vector mosquitoes, larval source management (LSM), targets the most productive breeding sites nearest to human habitation. In four riverine communities, we used drones with high-resolution imagery as a key initial step to analyze water bodies within the estimated flight range of Ny. darlingi, 1 km. We found distinctive spectral profiles for water bodies that were positive versus negative for Ny. darlingi. The methodology and analysis reported here provide the basis for testing whether LSM can be combined successfully with LLINs and IRS to contribute to the elimination of transmission in malaria hotspots in the Amazon.","[Carrasco-Escobar, Gabriel; Manrique, Edgar; Ruiz-Cabrejos, Jorge; Saavedra, Marlon; Gamboa, Dionicia] Univ Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Lab ICEMR Amazonia, Lab Invest & Desarrollo, Fac Ciencias & Filosofia, Lima, Peru; [Carrasco-Escobar, Gabriel; Ruiz-Cabrejos, Jorge] Univ Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Fac Salud Publ, Lima, Peru; [Alava, Freddy] Minist Hlth, Iquitos, Peru; [Bickersmith, Sara; Conn, Jan E.] New York State Dept Hlth, Wadsworth Ctr, Albany, NY USA; [Prussing, Catharine; Conn, Jan E.] SUNY Albany, Dept Biomed Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Albany, NY USA; [Vinetz, Joseph M.; Moreno, Marta] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Med, Div Infect Dis, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Vinetz, Joseph M.; Gamboa, Dionicia] Univ Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Inst Med Trop Alexander von Humboldt, Lima, Peru; [Gamboa, Dionicia] Univ Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Dept Ciencias Celulares & Mol, Fac Ciencias & Filosofia, Lima, Peru; [Vinetz, Joseph M.] Yale Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, Infect Dis Sect, New Haven, CT USA; [Moreno, Marta] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Immunol & Infect, London, England","Carrasco-Escobar, G (corresponding author), Univ Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Lab ICEMR Amazonia, Lab Invest & Desarrollo, Fac Ciencias & Filosofia, Lima, Peru.; Carrasco-Escobar, G (corresponding author), Univ Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Fac Salud Publ, Lima, Peru.; Moreno, M (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Med, Div Infect Dis, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.; Moreno, M (corresponding author), London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Immunol & Infect, London, England.",gabriel.carrasco@upch.pe; Marta.moreno@lshtm.ac.uk,"Prussing, Catharine/AAB-4546-2019; Moreno, Marta/AAW-8848-2020","Prussing, Catharine/0000-0001-6425-6839; Moreno, Marta/0000-0002-9091-5612; Ruiz Cabrejos, Jorge/0000-0002-2055-3396; Carrasco-Escobar, Gabriel/0000-0002-6945-0419; ALAVA AREVALO, FREDDY FRANCO/0000-0002-1402-2556; Bickersmith, Sara/0000-0002-2748-0425; Manrique, Edgar/0000-0002-0196-0818; Conn, Jan/0000-0002-5301-7020","TDR/WHOWorld Health Organization [201460655]; NIH-NIAIDUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [U19AI089681]; NIH R01United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [AI110112]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [U19AI089681, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, U19AI089681, R01AI110112, U19AI089681] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This study was funded by TDR/WHO (201460655) to DG and supported in part by NIH-NIAID (U19AI089681) to JMV and NIH R01 (AI110112) to JEC.

In Hawaii, Aedes albopictus (Skuse) (Diptera: Culicidae), the Asian tiger mosquito, has been implicated in locally-transmitted dengue outbreaks, while Culex quinquefasciatus Say (Diptera: Culicidae), the southern house mosquito, is the primary vector of avian malaria, a wildlife disease that has contributed to declines and extinctions of native Hawaiian birds. Despite the importance of these introduced species to human and wildlife health, little is known about the local-scale drivers that shape mosquito abundance across lowland Hawaii, where forest, agricultural, and residential land uses are prevalent. We examined landscape, larval habitat, and climate drivers of Ae. albopictus and Cx. quinquefasciatus abundance in eight lowland wet forest fragments on the Big Island of Hawaii. We found that the abundance of both species increased with the proportion of surrounding developed land and the availability of larval habitat, which were themselves correlated. Our findings suggest that conversion of natural habitats to residential and agricultural land increases mosquito larval habitats, increasing the abundance of Ae. albopictus and Cx. quinquefasciatus and increasing disease risk to humans and wildlife in Hawaii. Our results further indicate that while source reduction of artificial larval habitats-particularly moderately-sized human-made habitats including abandoned cars and tires-could reduce mosquito abundance, eliminating larval habitat will be challenging because both species utilize both natural and human-made larval habitats in lowland Hawaii.","[McClure, Katherine M.; Kilpatrick, A.

This study was conducted to assess the movement pattern of exophilic Anopheles mosquitoes between blood meal sources and resting habitats, and the landscape factors dictating their resting habitat choice. Results: Resting clay pots were placed at 5 m, 25 m, 50 m, 75 m and 100 m away from isolated focal houses, radiating from them in four directions. The locations of the clay pots represent heterogeneous land cover types at a relatively fine spatial scale in the landscape. The effect of the landscape characters on the number of both female and male anophelines caught was modelled using zero-inflated negative binomial regression with a log link function. A total of 420 Anopheles mosquitoes (353 females and 67 males) belonging to three species; Anopheles arabiensis, Anopheles pharoensis, and Anopheles tenebrosus were caught in the resting clay pots, with An. arabiensis being the dominant species. Canopy cover, distance from the house, and land cover type were the significant landscape characters influencing the aggregation of resting mosquitoes. Both the count and binary models showed that canopy cover was the strongest predictor variable on the counts and the presence of Anopheles mosquitoes in the clay pots. Female Anopheles were most frequently found resting in the pots placed in banana plantations, and at sampling points that were at the greater distances (75 m and 100 m) from the focal house. Conclusions: This study showed that exophilic Anopheles mosquitoes tend to rest in shaded areas some distance away from human habitation. These findings are important when targeting mosquitoes outdoors, complementing the existing effort being made to control malaria vectors indoors.","[Debebe, Yared; Tekie, Habte] Addis Ababa Univ, Dept Zool Sci, POB 1176, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Hill, Sharon R.; Ignell, Rickard] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Plant Protect Biol, Unit Chem Ecol, Alnarp, Sweden; [Hopkins, Richard J.] Univ Greenwich, Nat Resources Inst, London, England","Ignell, R (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Plant Protect Biol, Unit Chem Ecol, Alnarp, Sweden.",rickard.ignell@slu.se,"Hill, Sharon R/A-5121-2008","Hill, Sharon R/0000-0002-6474-0214; Hopkins, Richard/0000-0003-4935-5825",Swedish Research Council (VR/Uforsk),"This study was financially supported by the Swedish Research Council (VR/Uforsk) through funding to RI.

Among arthropods, mosquito midgut microbiota has been largely investigated, providing crucial insights on the role and implications of host-symbiont relationships. However, limited amount of studies addressed their efforts on the investigation of microbiota colonizing salivary glands and reproductive tracts, crucial organs for pathogen invasion and vertical transmission of symbiotic microorganisms. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing-based approach, we analysed the microbiota of gut, salivary glands and reproductive tracts of several mosquito species, representing some of the main vectors of diseases, aiming at describing the dynamics of bacterial communities within the individual. Results: We identified a shared core microbiota between different mosquito species, although interesting inter- and intra-species differences were detected. Additionally, our results showed deep divergences between genera, underlining microbiota specificity and adaptation to their host. Conclusions: The comprehensive landscape of the bacterial microbiota components may ultimately provide crucial insights and novel targets for possible application of symbionts in innovative strategies for the control of vector borne diseases, globally named Symbiotic Control (SC), and suggesting that the holobiont of different mosquito species may significantly vary. Moreover, mosquito species are characterized by distinctive microbiota in different organs, likely reflecting different functions and/or adaptation processes.","[Mancini, M., V; Darniani, C.; Cappelli, A.; Bozic, J.; Rossi, P.; Valzano, M.; Serrao, A.; Ricci, I; Favia, G.] Univ Camerino, Sch Biosci & Med Vet, Via Gentile III da Varano, I-62032 Camerino, Italy; [Accoti, A.; Tallarita, M.; Nunzi, E.; Catanzani, R.; Spaccapelo, R.] Univ Perugia, Dept Expt Med, Funct Genom Ctr, Via Lucio Severi 1, I-06132 Perugia, Italy; [Mancini, M., V] Ctr Virus Res, Level 3 Henry Wellcome Bldg,464 Bearsden Rd, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland","Favia, G (corresponding author), Univ Camerino, Sch Biosci & Med Vet, Via Gentile III da Varano, I-62032 Camerino, Italy.; Spaccapelo, R (corresponding author), Univ Perugia, Dept Expt Med, Funct Genom Ctr, Via Lucio Severi 1, I-06132 Perugia, Italy.",roberta.spaccapelo@unipg.it; guido.favia@unicam.it,"CAPPELLI, ALESSIA/AAU-6203-2020","Mancini, Maria Vittoria/0000-0002-5831-2379; Cappelli, Alessia/0000-0003-4553-9360","Italian Ministry for Education and Research (MIUR)Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR) [Prin 2012-2012T85B3R, PRIN 2015-JXC3JF]; University of Camerino [FAR2015]","This work was supported by the Italian Ministry for Education and Research (MIUR), awards numbers Prin 2012-2012T85B3R and PRIN 2015-JXC3JF, both to GF, and by the University of Camerino, award number FAR2015 to GF.

OSWALDOI; DIPTERA-CULICIDAE; BRAZILIAN AMAZON; PLASMODIUM-FALCIPARUM; SPECIES DELIMITATION; NUCLEOTIDE-SEQUENCES; ALBITARSIS COMPLEX; SOUTHERN COLOMBIA; NATURAL VECTORS,"Background: Deforestation in the Amazon and the social vulnerability of its settler communities has been associated with increased malaria incidence. The feeding biology of the most important malaria vectors in the region, notably Nyssorhynchus darlingi, compounds efforts to control vectors and reduce transmission of what has become known as Frontier Malaria. Exploring Anophelinae mosquito diversity is fundamental to understanding the species responsible for transmission and developing appropriate management and intervention strategies for malaria control in the Amazon River basin. Methods: This study describes Anophelinae mosquito diversity from settler communities affected by Frontier Malaria in the states of Acre, Amazonas and Rondonia by analysing CO/ gene data using cluster and tree-based species delimitation approaches. Results: In total, 270 specimens from collection sites were sequenced and these were combined with 151 reference (GenBank) sequences in the analysis to assist in species identification. Conservative estimates found that the number of species collected at these sites was between 23 (mPTP partition) and 27 (strict ABGD partition) species, up to 13 of which appeared to be new. Nyssorhynchus triannulatus and Nyssorhynchus braziliensis displayed exceptional levels of intraspecific genetic diversity but there was little to no support for putative species complex status. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that Anophelinae mosquito diversity continues to be underestimated in poorly sampled areas where frontier malaria is a major public health concern. The findings will help shape future studies of vector incrimination and transmission dynamics in these areas and support efforts to develop more effective vector control and transmission reduction strategies in settler communities in the Amazon River basin.","[Bourke, Brian P.; de Oliveira, Tatiane M.

These effects can significantly impact farmland irrigation, water transportation, and human health. However, methods for controlling its growth are not ideal, and control using biological and chemical agents can result in secondary pollution. The utilization of E. crassipes as a resource, for example, as animal feed or organic substrates, can not only turn waste into valuable resources, but it can also solve the problem of its growth, thus bringing about economic and ecological benefits. In this paper, the growth and ecological characteristics of E. crassipes, its nutrient composition, and resource utilization approaches were reviewed. The challenges associated with the large-scale utilization of E. crassipes were also analyzed in order to provide references for the control and resource utilization of the species. Regarding challenges such as the difficulty of cultivation and the high cost of harvesting and dehydrating, it is necessary to investigate the proper water surface and coverage characteristics of E. crassipes cultivation to assure adequate biomass and protect the ecological landscape. It is also necessary to evaluate the effect of E. crassipes cultivation on the health of aquatic ecosystems and the safety of the water environment in order to prevent the significant potential ecological and environmental risks. In addition, developing portable, high-efficiency facilities to promote the effectiveness of harvesting, transportation and dehydration are needed, as well as further improvement in the techniques of utilization and assessment of the economic value.","[Su, Weiping; Yao, Zhitong] Hangzhou Dianzi Univ, Coll Mat Sci & Environm Engn, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Sun, Qingping] Yangzhou Sinomircro Biotech Ltd, Yangzhou 225107, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Xia, Meisheng] Zhejiang Univ, Ocean Coll, Zhoushan 316021, Peoples R China; [Wen, Zhengshun] Zhejiang Ocean Univ, Sch Food Sci & Pharmaceut, Zhoushan 316022, Peoples R China","Yao, ZT (corresponding author), Hangzhou Dianzi Univ, Coll Mat Sci & Environm Engn, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",swp201309@163.com; sqp@163.com; msxia@zju.edu.cn; zswenmr@163.com; sxyzt@126.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51606055]; Key Laboratory for Solid Waste Management and Environment Safety Open Fund [SWMES 2017-01],This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 51606055) and the Key Laboratory for Solid Waste Management and Environment Safety Open Fund (Grant no.

However, there is still a paucity of data on the influence of LLIN use and other factors on mosquito bionomics in different epidemiological foci. The objective of this study was to provide updated data on the evolution of vector bionomics and malaria transmission patterns in the equatorial forest region of Cameroon over the period 2000-2017, during which LLIN coverage has increased substantially. Methods: The study was conducted in Olama and Nyabessan, two villages situated in the equatorial forest region. Mosquito collections from 2016-2017 were compared to those of 2000-2001. Mosquitoes were sampled using both human landing catches and indoor sprays, and were identified using morphological taxonomic keys. Specimens belonging to the An. gambiae complex were further identified using molecular tools. Insecticide resistance bioassays were undertaken on An. gambiae to assess the susceptibility levels to both permethrin and deltamethrin. Mosquitoes were screened for Plasmodium falciparum infection and blood-feeding preference using the ELISA technique. Parasitological surveys in the population were conducted to determine the prevalence of Plasmodium infection using rapid diagnostic tests. Results: A change in the species composition of sampled mosquitoes was recorded between the 2000-2001 collections and those of 2016-2017. A drop in the density of the local primary vectors An. nili and An. moucheti in the forest region was recorded, whereas there was an increase in the density of An. gambiae (s.l.), An. marshallii, An. ziemannii and An. paludis. A change in the biting behaviour from indoor to outdoor was recorded in Olama. Very few indoor resting mosquitoes were collected. A change in the night biting cycle was recorded with mosquitoes displaying a shift from night biting to late evening/early in the night. Several mosquitoes were found positive for Plasmodium infection, thus sustaining continuous transmission of malaria in both sites. Reduction of malaria transmission in Nyabessan was lower than that seen in Olama and associated with deforestation and the construction of a dam that may have enabled a more efficient vector, An. gambiae (s.l.), to invade the area. A high level of resistance to pyrethroids (permethrin and deltamethrin) was detected for An. gambiae in both sites. High parasite prevalence was recorded in both sites, with children of 0-16 years being the most affected. In both Olama and Nyabessan, bed net usage appeared to correlate to protection against malaria infection. Conclusions: The study shows important changes in the bionomics of vector populations and malaria transmission patterns in the equatorial forest region. The changes call for more concerted efforts to address challenges such as insecticide resistance, environmental modifications or behavioural changes affecting the performance of current control measures.","[Bamou, Roland; Tchuinkam, Timoleon] Univ Dschang, Lab Appl Biol & Ecol VBID LABEA, Vector Borne Infect Dis Unit, Dept Anim Biol,Fac Sci, POB 067, Dschang, Cameroon; [Bamou, Roland; Mbakop, Lili Ranaise; Kopya, Edmond; Ndo, Cyrille; Awono-Ambene, Parfait; Antonio-Nkondjio, Christophe] Org Coordinat Lutte Endemies Afrique Cent OCEAC, Lab Rech Paludisme, BP 288, Yaounde, Cameroon; [Mbakop, Lili Ranaise; Kopya, Edmond] Univ Yaounde I, Fac Sci, POB 337, Yaounde, Cameroon; [Ndo, Cyrille] Univ Douala, Fac Med & Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Biol Sci, POB 24157, Douala, Cameroon; [Ndo, Cyrille; Antonio-Nkondjio, Christophe] Vector Biol Liverpool Sch Trop Med, Pembroke Pl, Liverpool L3 5QA, Merseyside, England; [Rono, Martin Kibet] KEMRI Wellcome Trust Res Programme, Ctr Geog Med Res Coast, Kilifi, Kenya; [Rono, Martin Kibet; Mwangangi, Joseph] KEMRI Ctr Geog Med Res Kilifi, Kilifi, Kenya; [Mwangangi, Joseph] Pwani Univ, Hlth & Res Inst, Kilifi, Kenya","Antonio-Nkondjio, C (corresponding author), Org Coordinat Lutte Endemies Afrique Cent OCEAC, Lab Rech Paludisme, BP 288, Yaounde, Cameroon.; Antonio-Nkondjio, C (corresponding author), Vector Biol Liverpool Sch Trop Med, Pembroke Pl, Liverpool L3 5QA, Merseyside, England.",antonio_nk@yahoo.fr,,"BAMOU, Roland/0000-0001-9031-1731; Rono, Martin/0000-0002-7255-821X",WHO TDR grant [2016/602099-0]; Wellcome Trust senior Fellowship in Public Health and Tropical Medicine [202687/Z/16/Z],"This work received financial support from WHO TDR grant 2016/602099-0 and Wellcome Trust senior Fellowship in Public Health and Tropical Medicine (202687/Z/16/Z) to CAN.

To gain functional insight into the host cellular genes required for virus infection, we performed whole-blood RNA-seq, 37-plex mass cytometry of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and serum cytokine measurements of acute- and convalescent-phase samples obtained from 42 children naturally infected with CHIKV. Semi-supervised classification and clustering of single-cell events into 57 sub-communities of canonical leukocyte phenotypes revealed a monocyte-driven response to acute infection, with the greatest expansions in intermediate CD14(++)CD16(+) monocytes and an activated subpopulation of CD14(+) monocytes. Increases in acute- phase CHIKV envelope protein E2 expression were highest for monocytes and dendritic cells.

We evaluated host utilization over a 3-month period in 2013 in a residential landscape in College Station, Texas. PCR sequencing of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase 1 gene permitted molecular identification of vertebrate bloodmeals to the species level. Forage ratio analysis identified bird species that were overutilized and underutilized by comparing community feeding index values to expected relative abundance values of bird species, derived from eBird data. Community feeding index values were also used in conjunction with reservoir competence data from the literature to generate reservoir capacity index values, a means of identifying relative importance of vertebrate reservoir hosts. Of 498 blood-engorged Cx. quinquefasciatus, 313 (62.9%) were identified to vertebrate species. The majority (95.5%) of bloodmeals originated from avian species with the remainder from mammals, but not humans. Northern mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos) was the principal host for mosquito feeding in June and July, but northern cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) became primary host in August. Forage ratio analysis revealed the overutilization of house finch (Haemorhous mexicanus), American robin (Turdus migratorius), northern mockingbird, northern cardinal, white-winged dove (Zenaida asiatica), and mourning dove (Zenaida macroura). Great-tailed grackle (Quiscalus mexicanus), blue jay (Cyanocitta cristata), and Carolina wren (Thryothorus ludovicianus) were under-utilized relative to availability. Reservoir capacity calculations suggested that northern mockingbird and northern cardinal were the principal amplifiers in the study area. These data identify the primary avian species contributing to the enzootic amplification of WNV in East-Central Texas and reveal that the heavy feeding on moderately competent hosts and no feeding on humans likely limit epidemics in this region.","[Komar, Nicholas; Panella, Nicholas A.] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Div Vector Borne Dis, 3150 Rampart Rd, Ft Collins, CO 80521 USA; [Golnar, Andrew J.; Hamer, Gabriel L.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Entomol, TAMU 2475, College Stn, TX 77843 USA","Komar, N (corresponding author), Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Div Vector Borne Dis, 3150 Rampart Rd, Ft Collins, CO 80521 USA.",nkomar@cdc.gov,,,Mosquito Research Foundation; Centers for Disease Control and PreventionUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesCenters for Disease Control & Prevention - USA,"We thank the numerous residents of households in College Station, Texas, that granted us permission to trap mosquitoes on their property.

Predicting how environmental changes will impact VBD transmission is dependent on understanding the ecology and behaviour of potential vector species outside of domestic settings. However there are few reliable sampling tools for measuring the habitat preference and host choice of mosquito vectors; with almost none suitable for sampling recently blood-fed, resting mosquitoes. This study evaluated the use of two mosquito traps: the resting bucket (RB) and sticky resting bucket (SRB) traps relative to CDC backpack aspiration (CDC) for sampling mosquitoes resting in a range of habitats representing a gradient of deforestation. Eight habitats were selected for sampling around two villages in Kudat District, Malaysian Borneo, to reflect the range of habitats available to mosquitoes in and around human dwellings, and nearby forest habitats where reservoir hosts are present: secondary forest (edge, interior and canopy); plantations (palm and rubber); and human settlements (inside, under and around houses). Results: Over 31 days, 2243 mosquitoes were collected in 5748 discrete collections. Nine mosquito genera were sampled with Aedes and Culex species being present in all habitats and most abundant. RB and CDC backpack aspiration were most efficient for sampling Culex whereas CDC backpack aspiration and SRB were most efficient for Aedes. Most Aedes identified to species level were Ae. albopictus (91%), with their abundance being highest in forest edge habitats. In contrast, Culex were most abundant under houses. Most blood-fed mosquitoes (76%) were found in human settlements; with humans and chickens being the only blood source. Conclusions: RB and SRB traps proved capable of sampling mosquitoes resting in all sampled habitats. However, sampling efficiency was generally low (c.0.1 per trap per day), necessitating traps to be deployed in high numbers for mosquito detection. None of the traps were effective for sampling zoonotic malaria vectors; however, SRB collected relatively higher numbers of the dengue vector Ae. albopictus. The higher abundance of mosquitoes in forest edge habitats indicates the potential value of these traps for investigating sylvatic dengue transmission. This study has demonstrated the merits in application of simple resting traps for characterising mosquito vector resting behaviour outside of the home.","[Brown, Rebecca; Ferguson, Heather M.] Univ Glasgow, Coll Med Vet & Life Sci, Inst Biodivers Anim Hlth & Comparat Med, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Hing, Chua Tock] Univ Malaysia Sabah, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Dept Pathobiol & Med Diagnost, Kota Kinabalu 88400, Sabah, Malaysia; [Fornace, Kimberly] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Fac Infect & Trop Dis, London WC1E 7HT, England","Brown, R (corresponding author), Univ Glasgow, Coll Med Vet & Life Sci, Inst Biodivers Anim Hlth & Comparat Med, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",r.brown.3@research.gla.ac.uk,"Chua, Tock H/E-4157-2012; Fornace, Kimberly/ABF-7147-2020","Chua, Tock H/0000-0002-8984-8723; Fornace, Kimberly/0000-0002-5484-241X; Ferguson, Heather/0000-0002-9625-5176",British Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC DTP) [BB/J013854/1]; MonkeyBar Project (UK Research Councils Environmental and Social Ecology of Human Infectious Diseases Initiative (ESEI)) [G1100796],"This research was funded by the British Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC DTP, grant ref: BB/J013854/1) and in collaboration with the MonkeyBar Project (UK Research Councils Environmental and Social Ecology of Human Infectious Diseases Initiative (ESEI): G1100796).",,93,5,5,0,17,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1756-3305,,,PARASITE VECTOR,Parasites Vectors,JUN 14,2018,11,,,,,,,,346,10.1186/s13071-018-2926-1,,,15,Parasitology; Tropical Medicine,Parasitology; Tropical Medicine,GJ4TV,WOS:000435375800002,29898780,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published, Green Accepted",,,2020-12-20,

Understanding what drives urban transmission is hampered by inconsistencies in how urban contexts are defined. A dichotomized urban-rural approach, based on political boundaries may misclassify environments or fail to capture local drivers of risk. Small-scale agriculture in urban or peri-urban settings has been shown to be a major risk determinant. Methods: Household-level Anopheles abundance patterns in and around Malawi's commercial capital of Blantyre ('1.9 M pop.) were analysed. Clusters (N = 64) of five houses each located at 2.5 km intervals along eight transects radiating out from Blantyre city centre were sampled during rainy and dry seasons of 2015 and 2016. Mosquito densities were measured inside houses using aspirators to sample resting mosquitoes, and un-baited CDC light traps to sample host seeking mosquitoes. Results: Of 38,895 mosquitoes captured, 91% were female and 87% were Culex spp. Anopheles females (N = 5058) were primarily captured in light traps (97%). Anopheles abundance was greater during rainy seasons. Anopheles funestus was more abundant than Anopheles arabiensis, but both were found on all transects, and had similar associations with environmental risk factors. Anopheles funestus and An. arabiensis females significantly increased with distance from the urban centre, but this trend was not consistent across all transects. Presence of small-scale agriculture was predictive of greater Anopheles spp. abundance, even after controlling for urbanicity, number of nets per person, number of under-5-year olds, years of education, and season. Conclusions: This study revealed how small-scale agriculture along a rural-to-urban transition was associated with An. arabiensis and An. funestus indoor abundances, and that indoor Anopheles density can be high within Blantyre city limits, particularly where agriculture is present. Typical rural areas with lower house density and greater distance from urban centres reflected landscapes more suitable for Anopheles reproduction and house invasion. However, similar characteristics and elevated Anopheles abundances were also found around some houses within the city limits. Thus, dichotomous designations of urban or rural can obscure important heterogeneity in the landscape of Plasmodium transmission, suggesting the need for more nuanced assessment of urban malaria risk and prevention efforts.","[Dear, Nicole F.; Wilson, Mark L.] Univ Michigan, Dept Epidemiol, Sch Publ Hlth, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Kadangwe, Chifundo; Mzilahowa, Themba; Bauleni, Andy; Mathanga, Don P.] Univ Malawi, Coll Med, Malaria Alert Ctr, Blantyre, Malawi; [Mathanga, Don P.] Univ Malawi, Coll Med, Blantyre, Malawi; [Duster, Chifundo] Univ Malawi, Coll Med, Mol Core Lab, Malawi Int Ctr Excellence Malaria Res ICEMR, Blantyre, Malawi; [Walker, Edward D.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Microbiol & Mol Genet, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Dear, NF (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Epidemiol, Sch Publ Hlth, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",dearnic@umich.edu,,,"Malawi ICEMR [4U19AI089683]; Office of Global Public Health (School of Public Health) at the University of Michigan; International Institute, at the University of Michigan; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683, U19AI089683] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","Funding was provided by 4U19AI089683 for the Malawi ICEMR.

There is a dearth of knowledge about mosquitoes feeding preferences and their role as potential vectors of haemosporidian parasites, particularly in modified habitats. During 2013-2014 we sampled mosquitoes in five different land use types within a cloud forest matrix. From a total of 4107 adult mosquitoes, 90 were engorged. We extracted DNA from mosquito blood-meals, abdomens, and thoraxes, which belonged to seven different species. Seventeen specimens were positive for avian Plasmodium parasites. We were able to identify the blood-meal source of 10 mosquitoes, the identified vertebrate species were: Homo sapiens (Human), Sturnira hondurensis (Bat), and Bos taurus (Cow). Our results show that Culex restuans is positive for avian malaria and it is feeding on both humans and domestic animals at urban and pen-urban habitat types, where it is also an abundant species throughout the year. Furthermore, Aedes quadrivittatus, also positive for avian malaria, is feeding on humans in the well-preserved cloud forest, where this mosquito species is highly abundant. This study is the first in Mexico to provide reference data showing generalist mosquito feeding preferences and presence of avian Plasmodium at locations with different land use types.","[Antonio Abella-Medrano, Carlos; Ibanez-Bernal, Sergio] Inst Ecol AC, Red Ambiente & Sustentabilidad, Carretera Antigua Coatepec 351 El Haya, Xalapa 91070, Veracruz, Mexico; [Antonio Abella-Medrano, Carlos; Carbo-Ramirez, Pilar; Santiago-Alarcon, Diego] Inst Ecol AC, Red Biol & Conservac Vertebrados, Carretera Antigua Coatepec 351 El Haya, Xalapa 91070, Veracruz, Mexico","Santiago-Alarcon, D (corresponding author), Inst Ecol AC, Red Biol & Conservac Vertebrados, Carretera Antigua Coatepec 351 El Haya, Xalapa 91070, Veracruz, Mexico.",diego.santiago@inecol.mx,"RAMIREZ, PILAR CARBO/AAV-1488-2020; Santiago-Alarcon, Diego/AAF-3641-2020; Santiago-Alarcon, Diego/G-2485-2018","RAMIREZ, PILAR CARBO/0000-0002-0027-4074; Santiago-Alarcon, Diego/0000-0002-4914-5580; Santiago-Alarcon, Diego/0000-0002-4914-5580; Abella Medrano, Carlos Antonio/0000-0003-4889-2469",Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT)Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [CB-2011-01-168524]; CONACYTConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [335647],"We thank C.

Brazil has wetlands at different latitudes, which enables testing the influence of the ecological factors on the prevalence and diversity of haemosporidians. We identified avian haemosporidians in waterbird species in three wetlands and investigated the effects of vector habitat suitability, landscape and host characteristics on the diversity and prevalence of these parasites. Methods: We created a map with the probability of occurrence of avian haemosporidian vectors using maximum-entropy modelling based on references addressing species known to be vectors of haemosporidians in birds in Brazil. We determined the prevalence and diversity index of haemosporidians in the great egret (Ardea alba) (n = 129) and roseate spoonbill (Platalea ajaja) (n = 180) and compared the findings to data for the wood stork (Mycteria americana) (n = 199). Results: We report the first record of Plasmodium in the family Threskiornithidae: four lineages in the roseate spoonbill, which also presented one lineage of Haemoproteus. In the family Ardeidae, we found three Plasmodium lineages in the great egret. The similar habitat suitability for vectors found in three wetlands explains the pattern of haemosporidian diversity determined for great egret and wood stork populations. Comparisons of haemosporidian diversity within each waterbird species and between regions showed a higher level in the central-western roseate spoonbill population than in the northern population (P = 0.021). Removing the host effect, we discussed the results obtained in terms of characteristics of the Pantanal region. Comparisons of Plasmodium spp. prevalence among waterbird species within the same wetland showed higher level in roseate spoonbill (74%) than those found in the great egret (21%) and wood stork (11%). Excluding the environmental effect, we interpreted result focusing host characteristics that favour infection: time required for nestlings to be covered by feathers and migratory behaviour. Conclusions: The map of habitat suitability showed that wetlands located in a 30 degrees latitudinal range offer similar conditions for avian vectors species and diversity of haemosporidians. The lineages described in waterbirds were previously identified in birds of prey as Plasmodium paranucleophilum.","[Chahad-Ehlers, Samira; Pereira de Assis, Pamela Carla; Del Lama, Silvia Nassif] Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Genet & Evolucao, Rodovia Washington Luis,Km 235 SP-310, BR-13565905 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil; [Fushita, Angela Terumi] Univ Fed ABC, Ctr Engn Modelagem & Ciencias Aplicadas, Ave Estados 5001, BR-09210580 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Lacorte, Gustavo Augusto] Inst Fed Minas Gerais, Lab Biol Mol, Rodovia Bambui Medeiros,Km 5, BR-38900000 Bambui, MG, Brazil","Del Lama, SN (corresponding author), Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Genet & Evolucao, Rodovia Washington Luis,Km 235 SP-310, BR-13565905 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil.",dsdl@ufscar.br,"Chahad-Ehlers, Samira/H-8024-2015; Fushita, Angela Terumi/B-3855-2013","Chahad-Ehlers, Samira/0000-0003-2321-4389; Fushita, Angela Terumi/0000-0001-6595-708X","Brazilian fostering agency Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP - State of Sao Paulo Research Assistance Foundation) [2004/15205-8, 2010/50406-5, 2016/01673-7]","This study was supported by the Brazilian fostering agency Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP - State of Sao Paulo Research Assistance Foundation) through research grants to SNDL (2004/15205-8, 2010/50406-5, 2016/01673-7).",,81,2,2,0,22,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1756-3305,,,PARASITE VECTOR,Parasites Vectors,MAY 2,2018,11,,,,,,,,276,10.1186/s13071-018-2847-z,,,12,Parasitology; Tropical Medicine,Parasitology; Tropical Medicine,GE5LC,WOS:000431262400004,29716645,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2020-12-20,

Vector and host communities, as well as habitat characteristics, may have important but different impacts on the prevalence, richness and evenness of vector-borne parasites. 2. We investigated the relative importance of (1) the mosquito community composition, (2) the vertebrate community composition and (3) landscape characteristics on the prevalence, richness and evenness of avian Plasmodium. We hypothesized that parasite prevalence will be more affected by vector-related parameters, while host parameters should be also important to explain Plasmodium richness and evenness. 3. We sampled 2,588 wild house sparrows (Passer domesticus) and 340,829 mosquitoes, and we performed vertebrate censuses at 45 localities in the Southwest of Spain. These localities included urban, rural and natural landscapes that were characterized by several habitat variables. 4. Twelve Plasmodium lineages were identified in house sparrows corresponding to three major clades. Variation partitioning showed that landscape characteristics explained the highest fraction of variation in all response variables (21.0%-44.8%). Plasmodium prevalence was in addition explained by vector-related variables (5.4%) and its interaction with landscape (10.2%). Parasite richness and evenness were mostly explained by vertebrate community-related variables. 5. The structuring role of landscape characteristics in vector and host communities was a key factor in determining parasite prevalence, richness and evenness, although the role of each factor differed according to the parasite parameters studied. These results show that the biotic and abiotic contexts are important to explain the transmission dynamics of mosquito-borne pathogens in the wild.","[Ferraguti, Martina; Martinez-de la Puente, Josue; Roiz, David; Viana, Duarte S.; Figuerola, Jordi] CSIC, EBD, Dept Ecol Humedales, Seville, Spain; [Martinez-de la Puente, Josue; Ruiz, Santigo; Soriguer, Ramon C.; Figuerola, Jordi] CIBERESP, Madrid, Spain; [Bensch, Staffan] Lund Univ, Dept Biol, Lund, Sweden; [Ruiz, Santigo] Serv Control Mosquitos, Area Medio Ambiente, Diputac Huelva, Huelva, Spain; [Soriguer, Ramon C.] CSIC, EBD, Dept Etol & Conservac Biodiversidad, Seville, Spain; [Roiz, David] IRD, Infect Dis & Vectors Ecol Genet Evolut & Control, Montpellier, France; [Viana, Duarte S.] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv Halle Jene, Leipzig, Germany","Ferraguti, M (corresponding author), CSIC, EBD, Dept Ecol Humedales, Seville, Spain.",mferraguti@ebd.csic.es,"Ferraguti, Martina/C-6109-2015; Figuerola, Jordi/B-7917-2008; Viana, Duarte/AAA-1482-2020; la Puente, Josue Martinez-de/E-8597-2011; Roiz, David/F-2082-2011; Soriguer, Ramon/J-1494-2014","Ferraguti, Martina/0000-0001-7481-4355; Figuerola, Jordi/0000-0002-4664-9011; Viana, Duarte/0000-0002-7864-0871; la Puente, Josue Martinez-de/0000-0001-8055-4115; Roiz, David/0000-0002-5819-3648; Soriguer, Ramon/0000-0002-9165-7766","Junta de AndaluciaJunta de Andalucia [P11-RNM-7038, RNM118, RNM153]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competetion [CGL2012-30759, CGL2015-65055-P]; European Regional Development Fund (FEDER)European Union (EU) [FP7-261504 EDENext]; BBVA FoundationBBVA Foundation","Junta de Andalucia, Grant/Award Number: P11-RNM-7038, RNM118 and RNM153; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competetion, Grant/Award Number: CGL2012-30759 and CGL2015-65055-P; European Regional Development Fund (FEDER), Grant/Award Number: FP7-261504 EDENext; BBVA Foundation",,116,20,20,3,53,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

The identification of two novel tick-borne phleboviruses (TBPVs), severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) and Heartland virus (HRTV), as causative agents of severe illness in humans has accelerated the investigation and discoveries of novel TBPVs. In the present study, we isolated a novel TBPV designated Mukawa virus (MKWV) from host-questing lxodes persulcatus females captured in Japan. Genetic characterization revealed that MKWV is a member of the genus Phlebovirus in the family Phenuiviridae. Interestingly, MKWV is genetically distinct from other known TBPVs and shares a most recent common ancestor with mosquito/sandflyborne (insect-borne) phleboviruses. Despite its genetic similarity to insect-borne phleboviruses, the molecular footprints of its viral proteins and its biological characteristics define MKWV as a tick-borne virus that can be transmitted to mammals. A phylogenetic ancestral-state reconstruction for arthropod vectors of phleboviruses including MKWV based on viral L segment sequences indicated that ticks likely harbored ancestral phleboviruses that evolved into both the tick-borne and MKWV/insect-borne phlebovirus lineages. Overall, our findings suggest that most of the phlebovirus evolution has occurred in hard ticks to generate divergent viruses, which may provide a seminal foundation for understanding the mechanisms underlying the evolution and emergence of pathogenic phleboviruses, such as Rift Valley fever virus and SFTSV/HRTV. IMPORTANCE The emergence of novel tick-borne RNA viruses causing severe illness in humans has complicated the epidemiological landscape of tick-borne diseases, requiring further investigation to safeguard public health. In the present study, we discovered a novel tick-borne phlebovirus from lxodes persulcatus ticks in Japan. While its viral RNA genome sequences were similar to those of mosquito/sandfly-borne viruses, molecular and biological footprints confirmed that this is a tick-borne virus. The unique evolutionary position of the virus allowed us to estimate the ancestral phlebovirus vector, which was likely a hard tick. Our findings may provide a better understanding of the evolution and emergence of phleboviruses associated with emerging infectious diseases, such as severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) and Heartland virus disease.","[Matsuno, Keita; Mizuma, Keita] Hokkaido Univ, Fac Vet Med, Lab Microbiol, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan; [Matsuno, Keita; Igarashi, Manabu; Sawa, Hirofumi; Sugimoto, Chihiro; Takada, Ayato] Hokkaido Univ, Global Inst Collaborat Res & Educ GI CoRE, Div Int Serv, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan; [Kajihara, Masahiro; Mori-Kajihara, Akina; Muramatsu, Mieko; Igarashi, Manabu; Kasajima, Nodoka; Takada, Ayato] Hokkaido Univ, Res Ctr Zoonosis Control, Div Global Epidemiol, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan; [Nakao, Ryo] Hokkaido Univ, Fac Vet Med, Lab Parasitol, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan; [Nao, Naganori] Natl Inst Infect Dis, Dept Virol 3, Tokyo, Japan; [Qiu, Yongjin] Univ Zambia, Hokkaido Univ, Res Ctr Zoonosis Control, Hokudai Ctr Zoonosis Control Zambia, Lusaka, Zambia; [Torii, Shiho; Sawa, Hirofumi] Hokkaido Univ, Res Ctr Zoonosis Control, Div Mol Pathobiol, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan; [Yoshii, Kentaro] Hokkaido Univ, Fac Vet Med, Lab Publ Hlth, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan; [Sugimoto, Chihiro] Hokkaido Univ, Res Ctr Zoonosis Control, Div Collaborat & Educ, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan; [Ebihara, Hideki] Mayo Clin, Dept Mol Med, Rochester, MN USA","Ebihara, H (corresponding author), Mayo Clin, Dept Mol Med, Rochester, MN USA.",Ebihara.Hideki@mayo.edu,"Sawa, Hirofumi/F-6954-2012; Kajihara, Masahiro/AAF-5724-2020; Igarashi, Manabu/F-6871-2012","Qiu, Yongjin/0000-0001-8621-5472","Akiyama Life Science Foundation; MEXT/JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [JP17KT0045, JP16K18791, JP16H06431, JP16H06429, JP16K21723, JP16H05805, JP15K18778]; Japan Initiative for Global Research Network on Infectious Diseases (J-GRID)Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT); Japan Initiative for Progress of Research on Infectious Disease for Global Epidemic (J-PRIDE) (AMED grant) [JP18fm0108008, JP17fm0208001]; AMED/Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) of the Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS)Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED); Fusion-H program from Hokkaido University","This study was partly supported by the Akiyama Life Science Foundation, MEXT/JSPS KAKENHI (grant numbers JP17KT0045, JP16K18791, JP16H06431, JP16H06429, JP16K21723, JP16H05805, and JP15K18778), the Japan Initiative for Global Research Network on Infectious Diseases (J-GRID) and the Japan Initiative for Progress of Research on Infectious Disease for Global Epidemic (J-PRIDE) (AMED grant no.

Recent introductions in Cairns, Australia have demonstrated slower than expected spatial spread. Potential reasons for this include: (i) barriers to Ae. aegypti dispersal; (ii) higher incidence of long-range dispersal; and (iii) intergenerational loss of Wolbachia. We investigated these three potential factors using genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and an assay for the Wolbachia infection wMel in 161 Ae. aegypti collected from Cairns in 2015. We detected a small but significant barrier effect of Cairns highways on Ae. aegypti dispersal using distance-based redundancy analysis and patch-based simulation analysis. We detected a pair of putative full-siblings in ovitraps 1312 m apart, indicating long-distance female movement likely mediated by human transport. We also found a pair of full-siblings of different infection status, indicating intergenerational loss of Wolbachia in the field. These three factors are all expected to contribute to the slow spread of Wolbachia through Ae. aegypti populations, though from our results it is unclear whether Wolbachia loss and long-distance movement are sufficiently common to reduce the speed of spatial spread appreciably. Our findings inform the strategic deployment of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes during releases, and show how parameter estimates from laboratory studies may differ from those estimated using field data. Our landscape genomics approach can be extended to other host/symbiont systems that are being considered for biocontrol.","[Schmidt, Thomas L.; Filipovic, Igor; Hoffmann, Ary A.; Rasic, Gordana] Univ Melbourne, Inst Bio21, Sch BioSci, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia","Schmidt, TL (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Inst Bio21, Sch BioSci, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.",tom.schmidt@unimelb.edu.au,"Hoffmann, Ary/R-2972-2019; Rasic, Gordana/AAO-4360-2020","Hoffmann, Ary/0000-0001-9497-7645; Rasic, Gordana/0000-0002-3057-0093; Filipovic, Igor/0000-0001-9790-5639",National Health and Medical Research CouncilNational Health and Medical Research Council of Australia,"We would like to thank Eliminate Dengue Cairns, particularly field officer Angela Caird, for assistance with ovitrap deployment.

Large urban mosquito populations can represent a significant risk for transmission of emergent arboviral infection. However, even large mosquito populations are only a risk to the animals they bite. The purpose of this study is to identify and assess spatial patterns of host-use in a temperate urban landscape with heterogeneous socio-economic and ecological conditions. Results: Mosquito blood meals were collected from neighborhoods categorized along a socio-economic gradient in Baltimore, MD, USA. Blood meal hosts were identified for two Aedes (Ae. albopictus and Ae. japonicus) and three Culex (Cx. pipiens, Cx. restuans and Cx. salinarius) species. The brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) was the most frequently detected host in both Aedes species and Cx. salinarius. Human biting was evident in Aedes and Culex species and the proportion of human blood meals from Ae. albopictus varied significantly with neighborhood socio-economic status. Aedes albopictus was most likely to feed on human blood hosts (at 50%) in residential blocks categorized as having income above the city median, although there were still more total human bites detected from lower income blocks where Ae. albopictus was more abundant. Birds were the most frequently detected Culex blood hosts but were absent from all Aedes sampled. Conclusions: This study highlights fine-scale variation in host-use by medically important mosquito vectors and specifically investigates blood meal composition at spatial scales relevant to urban mosquito dispersal and human exposure. Further, the work emphasizes the importance of neighborhood economics and infrastructure management in shaping both the relative abundance of vectors and local blood feeding strategies. The invasive brown rat was an important blood source across vector species and neighborhoods in Baltimore. We show that social and economic conditions can be important predictors of transmission potential in urban landscapes and identify important questions about the role of rodents in supporting urban mosquito populations.","[Goodman, Heather; LaDeau, Shannon L.] Cary Inst Ecosyst Studies, Millbrook, NY 12545 USA; [Egizi, Andrea] Tick Borne Dis Lab, Monmouth Cty Div Mosquito Control, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Fonseca, Dina M.] Rutgers State Univ, Entomol Dept, Ctr Vector Biol, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Leisnham, Paul T.] Univ Maryland, Dept Environm Sci & Technol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","LaDeau, SL (corresponding author), Cary Inst Ecosyst Studies, Millbrook, NY 12545 USA.",ladeaus@caryinstitute.org,"Egizi, Andrea/AAV-1689-2020; Fonseca, Dina/B-9951-2011","Egizi, Andrea/0000-0002-4604-045X; LaDeau, Shannon/0000-0003-4825-5435; Fonseca, Dina/0000-0003-4726-7100; Leisnham, Paul T./0000-0003-3527-8435",National Science Foundation Baltimore Ecosystem Study [NSF-LTER DEB 1027188]; NSF Coupled Natural Human Systems ProgramNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 1211797],The authors recognize the financial support of the National Science Foundation Baltimore Ecosystem Study (NSF-LTER DEB 1027188) and the NSF Coupled Natural Human Systems Program (DEB 1211797).,,92,10,10,3,22,BIOMED CENTRAL LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, FLOOR 6, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",1756-3305,,,PARASITE VECTOR,Parasites Vectors,APR 10,2018,11,,,,,,,,218,10.1186/s13071-018-2779-7,,,10,Parasitology; Tropical Medicine,Parasitology; Tropical Medicine,GC5HW,WOS:000429819200001,29631602,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2020-12-20,

This leaves public health agencies with an incomplete understanding of the spectrum of infection risk across the diverse geography of the Australian continent. The current investigation sought to assess the risk of RRV epidemics based on abiotic and biotic landscape features in anthropogenic landscapes, with a particular focus on the influence of water and wildlife hosts. Methods: Abiotic features, including hydrology, land cover and altitude, and biotic features, including the distribution of wild mammalian hosts, were interrogated using a Maxent model to discern the landscape suitability to RRV epidemics in anthropogenically impacted environments across Australia. Results: Water-soil balance, proximity to controlled water reservoirs, and the ecological niches of four species (Perameles nasuta, Wallabia bicolor, Pseudomys novaehollandiae and Trichosurus vulpecula) were important features identifying high risk landscapes suitable for the occurrence of RRV epidemics. Conclusions: These results help to delineate human infection risk and thus provide an important perspective for geographically targeted vector, wildlife, and syndromic surveillance within and across the boundaries of local health authorities. Importantly, our analysis highlights the importance of the hydrology, and the potential role of mammalian host species in shaping RRV epidemic risk in peri-urban space. This study offers novel insight into wildlife hosts and RRV infection ecology and identifies those species that may be beneficial to future targeted field surveillance particularly in ecosystems undergoing rapid change.","[Walsh, Michael G.; Webb, Cameron] Univ Sydney, Westmead Inst Med Res, Marie Bashir Inst Infect Dis & Biosecur, Westmead, NSW, Australia; [Webb, Cameron] Westmead Hosp, NSW Hlth Pathol, Dept Med Entomol, Westmead, NSW, Australia","Walsh, MG (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Westmead Inst Med Res, Marie Bashir Inst Infect Dis & Biosecur, Westmead, NSW, Australia.",thegowda@gmail.com,,"Webb, Cameron/0000-0003-1029-5140; Walsh, Michael/0000-0002-6441-3635",,,,72,8,8,2,12,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1756-3305,,,PARASITE VECTOR,Parasites Vectors,MAR 20,2018,11,,,,,,,,192,10.1186/s13071-018-2776-x,,,11,Parasitology; Tropical Medicine,Parasitology; Tropical Medicine,GA4GU,WOS:000428288700002,29554980,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2020-12-20,

Zoonotic vector-borne disease prevalence is affected by vector, human, and reservoir host factors, which are influenced by habitat and climate; these 5 components interact on microhabitat-to-landscape scales but are often analyzed at a single spatial scale. Methods. We present an information theoretic, multiscale, multiple regression analysis of the ecological drivers of Ross River virus. We analyze the spatial pattern of 20 years of Ross River virus infections from South Australia (1992-2012; n = 5261), using variables across these 5 components of disease ecology at 3 spatial scales. Results. We found that covariate importance depended on the spatial scale of the analysis; some biotic variables were more important at fine scales and some abiotic variables were more important at coarser spatial scales. The urban score of an area was most predictive of infections, and mosquito variables did not improve the explanatory power of these models. Conclusions. Through this multiscale analysis, we identified novel drivers of the spatial distribution of disease and recommend public health interventions. Our results underline that single-scale analyses may paint an incomplete picture of disease drivers, potentially creating a major flaw in epidemiological analyses. Multiscale, ecological analyses are needed to better understand infectious disease transmission.","[Flies, Emily J.; Williams, Craig R.] Univ South Australia, Sch Pharm & Med Sci, Mawson Lakes, Australia; [Weinstein, Philip] Adelaide Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Flies, Emily J.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Biol Sci, Private Bag 55, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Koolhof, Iain] Univ Tasmania, Menzies Inst Med Res, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Anderson, Sharolyn J.] Univ South Australia, Sch Nat & Built Environm, Mawson Lakes, Australia; [Foufopoulos, Johannes] Univ Michigan, Sch Sustainabil & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Flies, EJ (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Sch Biol Sci, Private Bag 55, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",Emily.Flies@utas.edu.au,"Flies, Emily/T-4866-2019; Williams, Craig/A-1617-2011; Flies, Emily J./F-4686-2013","Williams, Craig/0000-0002-4758-1506; Weinstein, Philip/0000-0001-9860-7166; Foufopoulos, Johannes/0000-0002-8341-8271; Flies, Emily J./0000-0002-1013-0330",,,,50,7,7,0,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0022-1899,1537-6613,,J INFECT DIS,J.

Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) spread by Aedes mosquitoes are (re) emerging in many parts of the tropics, partially explained by changes in agricultural land-use. We explored the effects of land-use changes on the abundance, distribution, and host-seeking behavior of Aedes mosquitoes along a gradient of anthropogenic disturbance in oil palm-dominated landscapes in southeastern Cote d'Ivoire. Methodology Between January and December 2014, eggs, larvae, pupae, and adults of Aedes mosquitoes were sampled in four types of macrohabitats (rainforest, polyculture, oil palm monoculture, and rural housing areas), using standard procedures (bamboo-ovitraps, metallicovitraps, larval surveys, and human-baited double-net traps). Immature stages were reared and adult mosquitoes identified at species level. Principal findings A total of 28,276 Aedes specimens belonging to 11 species were collected. No Aedes-positive microhabitat and only four specimens of Ae. aegypti were found in oil palm monoculture. The highest abundance of Aedes mosquitoes (60.9%) was found in polyculture, while the highest species richness (11 species) was observed in rainforest. Ae. aegypti was the predominant Aedes species, and exhibited high anthropophilic behavior inflicting 93.0% of total biting to humans. The biting rate of Aedes mosquitoes was 34.6 and 7.2-fold higher in polyculture and rural housing areas, respectively, compared to rainforest. Three species (Ae. aegypti, Ae. dendrophilus, and Ae. vittatus) bit humans in polyculture and rural housing areas, with respective biting rates of 21.48 and 4.48 females/person/day. Unexpectedly, all three species were also feeding during darkness. Aedes females showed bimodal daily feeding cycles with peaks at around 08: 00 a. m. and 05: 00 p. m. Host-seeking activities were interrupted between 11: 00 a. m. and 02: 00 p. m. in rural housing areas, while no such interruption was observed in polyculture. Some rainforest-dwelling Aedes species displayed little preference to feed on humans. Conclusions In southeastern Co A te d'Ivoire, the agricultural land-use/land-cover changes due to the conversion of rainforest into oil palm monocultures influence the abundance, distribution, and host-seeking behaviors of anthropophagic and non-anthropophagic Aedes vectors. As a result, there is higher risk of humans to arbovirus transmission in polyculture and rural housing areas. There is a need for integrated vector management, including landscape epidemiology and ecotope-based vector control.","[Zahouli, Julien B.

Wasps displaced within their probable foraging grounds returned to their nests on the day of release although they oriented randomly upon release; however, wasps fed before release returned sooner, displaying nest-ward orientation. When displaced to places far from their nests, thus expected to be unfamiliar, only a third returned on the day of release showing nest-ward orientation; others oriented randomly and either returned on subsequent days or never. When confined within mosquito-net tents since eclosion and later released to places close to their nests (but unfamiliar), even fed wasps oriented randomly, and only older wasps returned, taking longer time. Thus, contrary to insects inhabiting less-featured landscapes, R. marginata foragers appear to have thorough familiarity with their foraging grounds that enables them to orient and home efficiently after passive displacement. Their initial orientation is, however, determined by an interaction of the information acquired from surrounding landscape and their physiological motivation. With age, they develop skills to home from unfamiliar places. Homing behaviour in insects appears to be influenced by evolutionarily conserved mechanisms and the landscape in which they have evolved.","[Mandal, Souvik; Brahma, Anindita; Gadagkar, Raghavendra] Indian Inst Sci, Ctr Ecol Sci, Div Biol Sci, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India","Mandal, S (corresponding author), Indian Inst Sci, Ctr Ecol Sci, Div Biol Sci, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India.",souvik@ces.iisc.ernet.in,"Gadagkar, Raghavendra/E-3944-2012","Gadagkar, Raghavendra/0000-0002-0328-9378; Mandal, Souvik/0000-0002-9552-5613","Department of Science and TechnologyDepartment of Science & Technology (India); Department of Biotechnology; Ministry of Environment and Forests; Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Government of IndiaCouncil of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India","We thank Kavita Isvaran and Diptarup Nandi for their help with statistical analyses, and Thomas S.

Parasites infecting humans originate from genetically distinct subpopulations associated with the long-tailed (Macaca fascicularis (Mf)) or pig-tailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina (Mn)). We used a new high-quality reference genome to re-evaluate previously described subpopulations among human and macaque isolates from Malaysian-Borneo and Peninsular-Malaysia. Nuclear genomes were dimorphic, as expected, but new evidence of chromosomal-segment exchanges between subpopulations was found. A large segment on chromosome 8 originating from the Mn subpopulation and containing genes encoding proteins expressed in mosquito-borne parasite stages, was found in Mf genotypes. By contrast, non-recombining organelle genomes partitioned into 3 deeply branched lineages, unlinked with nuclear genomic dimorphism. Subpopulations which diverged in isolation have re-connected, possibly due to deforestation and disruption of wild macaque habitats. The resulting genomic mosaics reveal traits selected by host-vector-parasite interactions in a setting of ecological transition.","[Benavente, Ernest Diez; Moon, Robert W.; Blackman, Michael J.; Roper, Cally; Drakeley, Christopher J.; Sutherland, Colin J.; Hibberd, Martin L.; Campino, Susana; Clark, Taane G.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Fac Infect & Trop Dis, London, England; [de Sessions, Paola Florez; Hibberd, Martin L.] Biopolis, Genome Inst Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; [Holder, Anthony A.; Blackman, Michael J.] Francis Crick Inst, London, England; [Pain, Arnab] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia; [Clark, Taane G.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Fac Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, London, England","Clark, TG (corresponding author), London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Fac Infect & Trop Dis, London, England.; Clark, TG (corresponding author), London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Fac Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, London, England.",taane.clark@lshtm.ac.uk,"Moon, Robert/AAF-9808-2019; Sutherland, Colin/AAN-3939-2020; Holder, Anthony A/A-7554-2013; Campino, Susana/AAM-2577-2020; Clark, Taane G./AAM-2570-2020; Pain, Arnab/L-5766-2015; Roper, Cally/K-2989-2013","Sutherland, Colin/0000-0003-1592-6407; Holder, Anthony A/0000-0002-8490-6058; Campino, Susana/0000-0003-1403-6138; Clark, Taane G./0000-0001-8985-9265; Diez Benavente, Ernest/0000-0002-4313-4290; Hibberd, Martin/0000-0001-8587-1849; Pain, Arnab/0000-0002-1755-2819; Roper, Cally/0000-0002-6545-309X; Blackman, Michael/0000-0002-7442-3810","Medical Research Council UKMedical Research Council UK (MRC) [MR/K000551/1, MR/M01360X/1, MR/N010469/1, MC_PC_15103]; MRCMedical Research Council UK (MRC); UK MRCMedical Research Council UK (MRC); UK Department for International Development; Cancer Research UKCancer Research UK [FC001097, FC001043]; UK Medical Research CouncilMedical Research Council UK (MRC) [FC001097, FC001043]; Wellcome TrustWellcome Trust [FC001097, FC001043]","TGC is funded by the Medical Research Council UK (Grant no.

Spatial heterogeneity of mosquito resources, such as hosts and breeding sites, affects mosquito dispersal behavior. This paper analyzes and simulates the spreading of anopheles mosquito on a complex metapopulation, that is, networks of populations connected by migratory flows whose configurations are described in terms of connectivity distribution of nodes (patches) and the conditional probabilities of connections between nodes. We examine the impacts of vector dispersal on the persistence and extinction of a mosquito population in both homogeneous and heterogeneous landscapes. For uncorrelated networks in a homogeneous landscape, we derive an explicit formula of the basic offspring number R-0((m)). Using the theory of monotone operators, we obtain sufficient conditions for the global asymptotic stability of equilibria. Precisely, the value 1 of the basic offspring number is a forward bifurcation for the dynamics of anopheles mosquito, with the trivial (mosquito-free) equilibrium point being globally asymptotically stable (GAS) when R-0((m)) > 1, and one stable nontrivial (mosquito-persistent) equilibrium point being born with well determined basins of attraction when R-0((m)) >1. Theoretical results are numerically supported and the impact of the migration of mosquitoes are discussed through global sensitivity analysis and numerical simulations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The ecological and environmental conditions (including those created by humans through vector control programmes) that result in metapopulation dynamics remain poorly understood. The development of control strategies that would most effectively limit outbreaks given such dynamics is particularly urgent given the recent epidemics of dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses. We developed a stochastic, spatial model of vector-borne disease transmission, allowing for movement of hosts between patches. Our model is applicable to arbovirus transmission by Aedes aegypti in urban settings and was parametrized to capture Zika virus transmission in particular. Using simulations, we investigated the extent to which two aspects of vector control strategies are affected by human commuting patterns: the extent of coordination and cooperation between neighbouring communities. We find that transmission intensity is highest at intermediate levels of host movement. The extent to which coordination of control activities among neighbouring patches decreases the prevalence of infection is affected by both how frequently humans commute and the proportion of neighbouring patches that commits to vector surveillance and control activities. At high levels of host movement, patches that do not contribute to vector control may act as sources of infection in the landscape, yet have comparable levels of prevalence as patches that do cooperate. This result suggests that real cooperation among neighbours will be critical to the development of effective pro-active strategies for vector-borne disease control in today's commuter-linked communities.","[Stone, Chris M.] Univ Illinois, Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Champaign, IL 61820 USA; [Stone, Chris M.; Fefferman, Nina H.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Schwab, Samantha R.] Rutgers State Univ, Program Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Brunswick, NJ USA; [Fonseca, Dina M.] Rutgers State Univ, Ctr Vector Biol, New Brunswick, NJ USA","Stone, CM (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.; Stone, CM (corresponding author), Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",cstone@illinois.edu,"; Fonseca, Dina/B-9951-2011","Schwab, Samantha/0000-0002-4338-4943; Fonseca, Dina/0000-0003-4726-7100",National Science Foundation (NSF) RAPIDNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1640951],This work was supported by National Science Foundation (NSF) RAPID grant no. 1640951.,,53,7,7,0,17,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",1742-5689,1742-5662,,J R SOC INTERFACE,J.

Using a murine model that supports extensive skin infection with Leishmania donovani, spatial analyses at macro-(quantitative PCR) and micro-(confocal microscopy) scales indicate that parasite distribution is markedly skewed. Mathematical models accounting for this heterogeneity demonstrate that while a patchy distribution reduces the expected number of sand flies acquiring parasites, it increases the infection load for sand flies feeding on a patch, increasing their potential for onward transmission. Models representing patchiness at both macro- and micro-scales provide the best fit with experimental sand fly feeding data, pointing to the importance of the skin parasite landscape as a predictor of host infectiousness. Our analysis highlights the skin as a critical site to consider when assessing treatment efficacy, transmission competence and the impact of visceral leishmaniasis elimination campaigns.","[Doehl, Johannes S.

While some studies report that deforestation increases malaria risk, others claim the opposite. Assessing malaria risk requires examination of dynamic processes among three main components: (i) the environment (i.e. LULC and landscape transformations), (ii) vector biology (e.g. mosquito species distributions, vector activity and life cycle, plasmodium infection rates), and (iii) human populations (e.g. forest-related activity, host susceptibility, movement patterns). In this paper, we conduct a systematic literature review on malaria risk and deforestation in the Amazon focusing on these three components. We explore key features that are likely to generate these contrasting results using the reviewed articles and our own data from Brazil and Peru, and conclude with suggestions for productive avenues in future research.

Assessment of mosquito community diversity and, in particular, identification of environmental parameters shaping these communities is therefore of key importance for the design of adequate surveillance approaches. In this study, we assess effects of climatic parameters and habitat structure on mosquito communities in eastern Austria to deliver these highly relevant baseline data. Methods: Female mosquitoes were sampled twice a month from April to October 2014 and 2015 at 35 permanent and 23 non-permanent trapping sites using carbon dioxide-baited traps. Differences in spatial and seasonal abundance patterns of Culicidae taxa were identified using likelihood ratio tests; possible effects of environmental parameters on seasonal and spatial mosquito distribution were analysed using multivariate statistical methods. We assessed community responses to environmental parameters based on 14-day-average values that affect ontogenesis. Results: Altogether 29,734 female mosquitoes were collected, and 21 of 42 native as well as two of four non-native mosquito species were reconfirmed in eastern Austria. Statistical analyses revealed significant differences in mosquito abundance between sampling years and provinces. Incidence and abundance patterns were found to be linked to 14-day mean sunshine duration, humidity, water-level maxima and the amount of precipitation. However, land cover classes were found to be the most important factor, effectively assigning both indigenous and non-native mosquito species to various communities, which responded differentially to environmental variables. Conclusions: These findings thus underline the significance of non-climatic variables for future mosquito prediction models and the necessity to consider these in mosquito surveillance programmes.","[Zittra, Carina; Eigner, Barbara; Fuehrer, Hans-Peter] Univ Vet Med, Inst Parasitol, Dept Pathobiol, Vienna, Austria; [Vitecek, Simon; Waringer, Johann] Univ Vienna, Dept Limnol & Biooceanog, Vienna, Austria; [Obwaller, Adelheid G.] Fed Minist Def & Sports, Div Sci Res & Dev, Vienna, Austria; [Rossiter, Heidemarie] Donaustr 73, A-3421 Hoflein Donau, Austria; [Zechmeister, Thomas] Biol Stn Lake Neusiedl, Burgenland, Austria","Fuehrer, HP (corresponding author), Univ Vet Med, Inst Parasitol, Dept Pathobiol, Vienna, Austria.",hans-peter.fuehrer@vetmeduni.ac.at,"Fuehrer, Hans-Peter/J-9055-2019; Zittra, Carina/O-1445-2019","Fuehrer, Hans-Peter/0000-0002-4178-0133; Zittra, Carina/0000-0002-8963-6421; Vitecek, Simon/0000-0002-7637-563X",ERA-Net BiodivERsA; FWFAustrian Science Fund (FWF) [I 1437]; ANRFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [13 EBID 0007 01]; DFG as part of the BiodivERsA callGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [BiodivERsA KL 2087/6 1]; Austrian Science Fund (FWF)Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [I 1437] Funding Source: researchfish,"This research was funded by the ERA-Net BiodivERsA, with the national funders FWF I 1437, ANR 13 EBID 0007 01 and DFG BiodivERsA KL 2087/6 1 as part of the 2012-13 BiodivERsA call for research proposals.",,80,13,13,0,18,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1756-3305,,,PARASITE VECTOR,Parasites Vectors,APR 26,2017,10,,,,,,,,205,10.1186/s13071-017-2140-6,,,13,Parasitology; Tropical Medicine,Parasitology; Tropical Medicine,ET5FX,WOS:000400310700003,28441957,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2020-12-20,

Bats in farmland are crucial predators of crop pests, thus offering an economically important ecosystem service. It seems possible that bats may also provide services by feeding on insects associated with livestock. We tested whether bats forage over cattle in a traditionally managed pastoral area of central Italy, i.e. setting the bases for providing pest control services. We found that small bat species (mostly Pipistrellus spp.) foraged preferentially over livestock, and that their activity increased, but then reached a plateau or slightly decreased, for progressively larger herds. Landscape complexity also led to an increase in bat activity over livestock. Since insects attracted to cattle at night typically include flies such as mosquitoes (Culicidae) and biting midges (Ceratopogonidae), which are potentially harmful to cattle and may carry serious diseases, and that bats such as Pipistrellus spp. are important predators of such flies, we argue that bats may play a valuable pest-suppression role.

However, the roles that ecological interactions play in shaping the sequence of species phenologies through a season are largely unexplored. Across the tundra on the Hudson Bay Lowlands, extensive foraging by lesser snow goose populations has been driving alterations to the landscape. Here, I show that this widespread and dramatic disturbance increases evaporation rates of ephemeral ponds and consequently constricts the temporal availability of seasonal aquatic habitats for larval mosquitoes. I also show that this constriction decreases the temporal diversity of closely related univoltine mosquito species that have varying emergence schedules. Three species of mosquitoes emerged through the season from four sampled ephemeral ponds associated with no goose grubbing; only one species emerged, early in the season, from the four ponds that experienced heavy grubbing. This study demonstrates a mechanism for temporal composition change in a ubiquitous and abundant group of arthropods on the tundra. It does not show life history evolution of emergence time of mosquitoes; however, it highlights the rather unexplored role of ecological interactions in altering the diversity of phenologies across seasonal time.","[Park, John S.] Univ Chicago, Comm Evolutionary Biol, Culver Hall 402,1025 E 57th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Park, JS (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Comm Evolutionary Biol, Culver Hall 402,1025 E 57th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",johnspark@uchicago.edu,,"Park, John/0000-0003-2151-1160",Sherwood E.

This has been well explored for ticks, but not for mosquitoes, despite their importance in the transmission of a variety of pathogens. This study examined the importance of habitat, habitat edges, and the scale at which mosquito abundance and diversity vary in a rural landscape by trapping along transects from grassland areas into forest patches. Significant patterns of vector diversity and distinct mosquito assemblages across habitats were found. The scale of individual species' responses to habitat edges was often dramatic, with several species rarely straying even 10 m from the edge. The present results suggest blood-seeking mosquito species are faithful to certain habitats, which has consequences for patterns of vector diversity and risk for pathogen transmission. This implies that analysts of risk for pathogen transmission and foci of control, and developers of land management strategies should assess habitat at a finer scale than previously considered.","[Reiskind, M.

Temperate regions are generally expected to pose low risk for significant mosquito-borne disease; however, the spread of the Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) across densely populated urban areas has established a new landscape of risk. We use a model informed by field data to assess the conditions likely to facilitate local transmission of chikungunya and Zika viruses from an infected traveler to Ae. albopictus and then to other humans in USA cities with variable human densities and seasonality. Mosquito-borne disease occurs when specific combinations of conditions maximize virus-to-mosquito and mosquito-to-human contact rates. We develop a mathematical model that captures the epidemiology and is informed by current data on vector ecology from urban sites. The model demonstrates that under specific but realistic conditions, fifty-percent of introductions by infectious travelers to a high human, high mosquito density city could initiate local transmission and 10% of the introductions could result in 100 or more people infected. Despite the propensity for Ae. albopictus to bite non-human vertebrates, we also demonstrate that local virus transmission and human outbreaks may occur when vectors feed from humans even just 40% of the time. Inclusion of human behavioral changes and mitigations were not incorporated into the models and would likely reduce predicted infections. This work demonstrates how a conditional series of non-average events can result in local arbovirus transmission and outbreaks of human disease, even in temperate cities.","[Manore, Carrie A.] Tulane Univ, Ctr Computat Sci, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [Manore, Carrie A.] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Theoret Biol & Biophys, Los Alamos, NM 87544 USA; [Manore, Carrie A.] New Mexico Consortium, Suite Los Alamos, Los Alamos, NM 87544 USA; [Ostfeld, Richard S.; LaDeau, Shannon L.] Cary Inst Ecosyst Studies, Box AB, Millbrook, NY USA; [Agusto, Folashade B.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Haworth Hall, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Gaff, Holly] Old Dominion Univ, Dept Biol Sci, MGB, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA; [Gaff, Holly] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Math Stat & Comp Sci, Durban, South Africa","Manore, CA (corresponding author), Tulane Univ, Ctr Computat Sci, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA.; Manore, CA (corresponding author), Los Alamos Natl Lab, Theoret Biol & Biophys, Los Alamos, NM 87544 USA.; Manore, CA (corresponding author), New Mexico Consortium, Suite Los Alamos, Los Alamos, NM 87544 USA.",cmanore@tulane.edu,,"Agusto, Folashade/0000-0001-6137-6480; LaDeau, Shannon/0000-0003-4825-5435; Gaff, Holly/0000-0002-4034-2684; Ostfeld, Richard/0000-0002-3707-9301","National Science Foundation through NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DBI-1300426]; University of Tennessee, Knoxville; NSF SEES grantNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD) [CHE-1314029]; NSF RAPIDNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 1641130]; Los Alamos National Laboratory Directors Postdoctoral FellowshipUnited States Department of Energy (DOE)Los Alamos National Laboratory; NIH-MIDAS grant [U01-GM097661]; NSF CHNS grant [DEB 1211797]; KU grant [NFGRF 2302100]; Direct For Mathematical & Physical ScienNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS) [1660530] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division Of ChemistryNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS) [1660530] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Div Of Biological InfrastructureNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1300426] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [U01GM097661, U01GM097661, U01GM097661, U01GM097661, U01GM097661] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This work was conducted as a part of the Climate Change and Vector-borne Diseases Working Group at the National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis, by National Science Foundation through NSF Award #DBI-1300426, with additional support from The University of Tennessee, Knoxville.

In this study, we investigated a spatial pattern of genetic and phenotypic variation within seven urban and within six rural populations of Culex pipiens from Vojvodina Province (Serbia) incorporating landscape genetic methods (using allozyme data) and wing size and shape (using geometric morphometric approach). Comparing rural samples, no strong genetic groupings of individuals were detected. Nevertheless, traditional approaches where individuals are pre-assigned to populations, including F statistics and AMOVA (analysis of molecular variance), revealed low, but significant genetic differentiation among samples. Similarly, phenotypic data (wing size and shape) indicated some level of heterogeneity among rural samples. Contrary to genetic homogeneity found within rural biotype, the individual-based structuring characterized urban biotype. Geneland revealed the presence of two genetic clusters within urban group which is in concordance with FST and AMOVA results. These results showed that sample from Novi Sad (NS) is a distinct genetic unit, which has been likely resulted in intensive insecticide use over several decades. Furthermore, phenotypic differentiation supported the existence of spatial structuring.

DIPTERA; RICE FIELDS; ARABIENSIS,"Background: African highlands were known to be free of malaria for the past 50 years. However, the ever growing human population in the highlands of Africa has led to the deforestation and land coverage changes to create space for more land for cultivation, grazing, and house construction materials needs. This has lead to the creation of suitable breeding habitats, which are in open places. Decrease of canopy and forest cover has led to increased temperature both in outdoors and indoors in deforested areas. This increased temperature has resulted in the shortening of developmental stages of aquatic stages of mosquitoes and sporogony development in adult mosquitoes. Method: Assessment of the effects of deforestation and land coverage changes (decrease), which leads to temperature changes and subsequently increases survivorship of adults and sporogony development in adult mosquitoes' body was gathered from previous data collected from 2003 to 2012 using different analysis techniques. Habitats productivity, species dynamics and abundance, mosquitoes feeding rates, and sporogony development are presented in relation to temperature changes. Results: The effects of temperature rise due to land cover changes in highlands of western Kenya on larval developmental rates, adult sporogony developments, and malaria risk in human population were derived. Vector species dynamics and abundance in relation to land use changes have been found to change with time. Conclusion: This study found that, land cover changes is a key driver for the temperature rise in African highlands and increases the rate of malaria vectors Anopheles gambiae ssp., An. Funestus, and An. arabiensis colonizing the highlands. It has also significantly enhanced sporogony development rate and adult vector survival and therefore the risk of malaria transmission in the highlands.","[Kweka, Eliningaya J.; Kimaro, Epiphania E.] Trop Pesticides Res Inst, Div Livestock & Human Dis Vector Control, Mosquito Sect, Arusha, Tanzania; [Kweka, Eliningaya J.] Catholic Univ Hlth & Allied Sci, Dept Med Parasitol & Entomol, Mwanza, Tanzania; [Munga, Stephen] Kenya Govt Med Res Ctr, Ctr Global Hlth Res, Kisumu, Kenya","Kweka, EJ (corresponding author), Trop Pesticides Res Inst, Div Livestock & Human Dis Vector Control, Mosquito Sect, Arusha, Tanzania.; Kweka, EJ (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Hlth & Allied Sci, Dept Med Parasitol & Entomol, Mwanza, Tanzania.",kwekae@tpri.or.tz,,,"American National Institute of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [D43 TW01505, R01 AI-50243]","This work received financial support from American National Institute of Health (D43 TW01505 and R01 AI-50243).

This challenge is growing as the invasive mosquito vectors, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, expand their distributions and increase their population sizes. Hence there is an increasing need to devise effective control methods that can contain dengue outbreaks. Here we construct an epidemiological model for virus transmission between vectors and hosts on a network of host populations distributed among city and town patches, and investigate disease control through vaccination and vector control using variants of the sterile insect technique (SIT). Analysis of the basic reproductive number and simulations indicate that host movement across this small network influences the severity of epidemics. Both vaccination and vector control strategies are investigated as methods of disease containment and our results indicate that these controls can be made more effective with mixed strategy solutions. We predict that reduced lethality through poor SIT methods or imperfectly efficacious vaccines will impact efforts to control disease spread. In particular, weakly efficacious vaccination strategies against multiple virus serotype diversity may be counter productive to disease control efforts. Even so, failings of one method may be mitigated by supplementing it with an alternative control strategy. Generally, our network approach encourages decision making to consider connected populations, to emphasise that successful control methods must effectively suppress dengue epidemics at this landscape scale.

The pattern of malaria transmission in the highland plateau ecosystems is less distinct due to the flat topography and diffuse hydrology resulting from numerous streams. The non-homogeneous distribution of larval breeding habitats in east African highlands obviously affects Anopheles spatial distribution which, consequently, leads to heterogeneous human exposure to malaria. Another delicate parameter in the fragile transmission risk of malaria in the highlands is the rapid loss of primary forest due to subsistence agriculture. The implication of this change in land cover on malaria transmission is that deforestation can lead to changes in microclimate of both adult and larval habitats hence increase larvae survival, population density, and gametocytes development in adult mosquitoes. Deforestation has been documented to enhancing vectorial capacity of Anopheles gambiae by nearly 100% compared to forested areas. Method: The study was conducted in five different ecosystems in the western Kenya highlands, two U-shaped valleys (Iguhu, Emutete), two V-shaped valleys (Marani, Fort Ternan), and one plateau (Shikondi) for 16 months among 6- to 15-year-old children. Exposure to malaria was tested using circumsporozoite protein (CSP) and merozoite surface protein immunochromatographic antibody tests. Malaria parasite was examined using different tools, which include microscopy based on blood smears, rapid diagnostic test based on HRP 2 proteins, and serology based on human immune response to parasite and vector antigens have been also examined in the highlands in comparison with different topographical systems of western Kenya. Results: The results suggested that changes in the topography had implication on transmission in highlands of western Kenya and appropriate diagnosis, treatment, and control tool needed to be considered accordingly. Both plateau and U-shaped valley found to have higher parasite density than V-shaped valley. People in V-valley were less immune than in plateau and U-valley residents. Conclusion: Topography diversity in western Kenya highlands has a significant impact on exposure rates of human to malaria vectors and parasite. The residents of V-shaped valleys are at risk of having explosive malaria outbreaks during hyper-transmission periods due to low exposure to malaria parasite; hence, they have low immune response to malaria, while the U-shaped valleys have stable malaria transmission, therefore, the human population has developed immunity to malaria due to continuous exposure to malaria.","[Wanjala, Christine Ludwin] Kenya Govt Med Res Ctr, Ctr Global Hlth Res, Kisumu, Kenya; [Wanjala, Christine Ludwin] Masinde Muliro Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Med Lab Sci, Kakamega, Kenya; [Kweka, Eliningaya J.] Trop Pesticides Res Inst, Div Livestock & Human Dis Vector Control, Mosquito Sect, Arusha, Tanzania; [Kweka, Eliningaya J.] Catholic Univ Hlth & Allied Sci, Dept Med Parasitol & Entomol, Mwanza, Tanzania","Kweka, EJ (corresponding author), Trop Pesticides Res Inst, Div Livestock & Human Dis Vector Control, Mosquito Sect, Arusha, Tanzania.; Kweka, EJ (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Hlth & Allied Sci, Dept Med Parasitol & Entomol, Mwanza, Tanzania.",kwekae@tpri.or.tz,,,"International Development Research Centre, Canada (IDRC); DFID (UK) [104707-001]","Authors acknowledge the field Assistants who did data collection, namely, David Cheryot, Nicolas Juma, Jared Rioba, Lucy Atieli, Judith Otete, Eliud Simiyu, and Edna ototo, for their technical assistance.

It is transmitted by mosquitoes, and the main strategy for epidemic prevention and control is insecticide fumigation. Effective management is, however, proving elusive. People's day-to-day movement about the city is believed to be an important factor in the epidemiological dynamics. We use a simple model to examine the fundamental roles of broad demographic and spatial structures in epidemic initiation, growth and control. We show that the key factors are local dilution, characterised by the vector-host ratio, and spatial connectivity, characterised by the extent of habitually variable movement patterns. Epidemic risk in the population is driven by the demographic groups that frequent the areas with the highest vector-host ratio, even if they only spend some of their time there. Synchronisation of epidemic trajectories in different demographic groups is governed by the vector-host ratios to which they are exposed and the strength of connectivity. Strategies for epidemic prevention and management may be made more effective if they take into account the fluctuating landscape of transmission intensity associated with spatial heterogeneity in the vector-host ratio and people's day-to-day movement patterns.","[Falcon-Lezama, Jorge A.; Ramos-Castaneda, Jose] Inst Nacl Salud Publ, Ctr Invest Enfermedades Infecciosas, Colonia Sta Maria Ahuacatitlan, Univ 655, Cuernavaca 62100, Morelos, Mexico; [Martinez-Vega, Ruth A.] Org Latinoamer Fomento Invest Salud, Calle 110 21-30,Of 604, Bucaramanga, Santander, Colombia; [Kuri-Morales, Pablo A.] Subsecretaria Prevenc & Promoc Salud, Lieja 7,1er Piso, Ciudad De Mexico 06600, Mexico; [Ramos-Castaneda, Jose] Univ Texas Med Branch, UTMB Ctr Trop Dis, 301 Univ Blvd, Galveston, TX 77555 USA; [Adams, Ben] Univ Bath, Dept Math Sci, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England; [Falcon-Lezama, Jorge A.] Carlos Slim Hlth Inst, Lago Zurich 245,Edif Presa Falcon Piso 20, Ciudad De Mexico 11529, Mexico","Adams, B (corresponding author), Univ Bath, Dept Math Sci, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England.",b.adams@bath.ac.uk,"Martinez-Vega, Ruth/AAD-3601-2019; Ramos-Castaneda, jose/V-6678-2019","Martinez-Vega, Ruth/0000-0002-6477-334X; Adams, Ben/0000-0001-9955-5361; , Jorge Abelardo/0000-0001-9081-4064",Mexico's National Council for Science and TechnologyConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [CONACYT - SALUD-2012-01-161157]; CONACYTConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT); PISA Program from Juarez Autonomous University of Tabasco; CONACYT International Mobility Program from National Autonomous University of Mexico; Visiting Postgraduate Scholar Programme from University of Bath; Servicios de Salud de Morelos; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1300426] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"This work was partially funded by Mexico's National Council for Science and Technology (Grant Number: CONACYT - SALUD-2012-01-161157).

Therefore, symbionts that have evolved strategies to increase their host's ability to evade lethal parasites may have high penetrance, while detrimental symbionts would be selected against, leading to lower penetrance or extinction from the host population. In a natural population of the parasitoid wasp Hyposoter horticola in the Aland Islands (Finland), the Wolbachia strain wHho persists at an intermediate prevalence (similar to 50%). Additionally, there is a negative correlation between the prevalence of Wolbachia and a hyperparasitoid wasp, Mesochorus cf. stigmaticus, in the landscape. Using a manipulative field experiment, we addressed the persistence of Wolbachia at this intermediate level, and tested whether the observed negative correlation could be due to Wolbachia inducing either susceptibility or resistance to parasitism. We show that infection with Wolbachia does not influence the ability of the wasp to parasitize its butterfly host, Melitaea cinxia, but that hyperparasitism of the wasp increases in the presence of wHho. Consequently, the symbiont is detrimental, and in order to persist in the host population, must also have a positive effect on fitness that outweighs the costly burden of susceptibility to widespread parasitism.","[van Nouhuys, Saskya; Kohonen, Minna; Duplouy, Anne] Univ Helsinki, Metapopulat Res Ctr, Dept Biosci, PL 65,Viikinkaari 1, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Duplouy, A (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Metapopulat Res Ctr, Dept Biosci, PL 65,Viikinkaari 1, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",anne.duplouy@helsinki.fi,"Duplouy, Anne/H-3006-2019; van Nouhuys, Saskya/C-6813-2013","Duplouy, Anne/0000-0002-7147-5199; van Nouhuys, Saskya/0000-0003-2206-1368","Academy of FinlandAcademy of Finland [284601, 250444, 266021]",The project was funded by the Academy of Finland (grant nos 284601 and 250444 to I.

Accurate models of optimal foraging behaviour should acknowledge the extent to which animals can detect and regulate their intake of food based on smaller scale differences in food types. In particular, consideration of macro-nutrient distribution and how animals perceive this is limited in studies of optimal foraging, particularly in vertebrates and for animals that forage in groups. Here, we track shoals of eight mosquitofish as they forage in two environments that contain equal amounts of available energy but differ in their distribution of macro-nutrients. We provide empirical evidence that fish will distribute themselves within an environment in relation to the distribution of specific macro-nutrients. Also, fish make foraging decisions based on the macronutrient composition of patches, such that their durations on patches are longer when they have a higher concentration of protein and lower concentration of carbohydrate. The ratio of protein to carbohydrate does not affect the probability of a fish joining a patch, however, with low numbers of fish on the patch the probability of a fish leaving is greater per unit time step in the patches with a low protein to carbohydrate ratio than the patches with a high protein to carbohydrate ratio. This study confirms the importance of considering the macro-nutrient composition of foods when considering the movement decisions of foraging groups and thus has important consequences for developing more accurate foraging models that take into account the distribution of macro-nutrients in the environment. The results suggest the spatial distribution of nutrients on a landscape scale could influence grouping patterns and social interactions, thus affecting population dynamics.","[Hansen, Matthew J.; Schaerf, Timothy M.; Ward, Ashley J.

We show the existence of a globally stable steady state, and a threshold that determines whether a pathogen is either absent from all patches, or endemic and present at some level in all patches. Each patch is characterized by a local basic reproduction number, whose value predicts whether the disease is cleared or not when the patch is isolated: patches are known as demographic sinks if they have a local basic reproduction number less than one, and hence would clear the disease if isolated; patches with a basic reproduction number above one would sustain endemic infection in isolation, and become demographic sources of parasites when connected to other patches. Sources are also considered focal areas of transmission for the larger landscape, as they export excess parasites to other areas and can sustain parasite populations. We show how to determine the various basic reproduction numbers from steady state estimates in the patched network and knowledge of additional model parameters, hereby identifying parasite sources in the process. This is useful in the context of control of the infection on natural landscapes, because a commonly suggested strategy is to target focal areas, in order to make their corresponding basic reproduction numbers less than one, effectively turning them into sinks. We show that this is indeed a successful control strategy albeit a conservative and possibly expensive one in case either the human host, or the vector does not move. However, we also show that when both humans and vectors move, this strategy may fail, depending on the specific movement patterns exhibited by hosts and vectors. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

However, the distribution of WNV transmission is dependent on the mosquito vector and the ecological requirements, which vary from one place to another. Methods: Presence/density data of two WNV mosquito vectors, Culex nigripalpus and Cx. quinquefasciatus, was extracted within 5 km buffer zones around seropositive records of sentinel chickens in order to delineate their predicting variables and model the habitat suitability of probable infective mosquito using MaxEnt software. Different correlations between density data of the extracted mosquito vectors and 27 climate, land use-land cover, and land surface terrain variables were analyzed using linear regression analysis. Accordingly, the correlated predicting variables were used in building up habitat suitability model for the occurrence records of both mosquito vectors using MaxEnt. Results: The density of both WNV mosquito vectors showed variation in their ecological requirements. Eight predicting variables, out of 27, had significant influence on density of Cx. nigripalpus. Precipitation of driest months was shown to be the best predicting variable for the density of this vector (R-2 = 41.70). Whereas, two variables were proven to predict the distribution of Cx. quinquefasciatus density. Vegetation showed the maximum predicting gain to the density of this mosquito vector (R-2 = 15.74), where nestling birds, in particular exotics, are found. Moreover, Jackknife analysis in MaxEnt demonstrated that urbanization and vegetation data layers significantly contribute in predicting habitat suitability of Cx. nigripalpus and Cx. quinquefasciatus occurrence, respectively, which justifies the contribution of the former in urban and the latter in epizootic transmission cycles of WNV. In addition, habitat suitability risk maps were produced for both vectors in response to their predicting variables. Conclusions: For the first time in the study area, a quantitative relationship between 27 predicting variables and two WNV mosquito vectors within their foraging habitats was highlighted at the local scale. Accordingly, the predicting variables were used to produce a practical distribution map of probable infective mosquito vectors. This substantially helps in determining where suitable habitats are found. This will potentially help in designing target surveillance and control programmes, saving money, time and man-power. However, the suitability risk maps should be updated when serological and entomological data updates are available.","[Sallam, Mohamed F.; Pereira, Roberto M.; Koehler, Phillip G.] Univ Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Sallam, Mohamed F.; Xue, Rui-De] Anastasia Mosquito Control Dist, St Augustine, FL 32080 USA; [Sallam, Mohamed F.] Ain Shams Univ, Coll Sci, Cairo 11566, Egypt","Sallam, MF (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.; Sallam, MF (corresponding author), Anastasia Mosquito Control Dist, St Augustine, FL 32080 USA.",mdsallam@ufl.edu,"Pereira, Roberto/B-5008-2010; Pereira, Rosa Maria Rodrigues/C-5192-2012","Pereira, Roberto/0000-0002-5618-7690; Pereira, Rosa Maria Rodrigues/0000-0002-3723-5028",Institute of Food and Agriculture Sciences/IFAS,Institute of Food and Agriculture Sciences/IFAS.,,49,13,14,2,32,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1756-3305,,,PARASITE VECTOR,Parasites Vectors,JUN 29,2016,9,,,,,,,,371,10.1186/s13071-016-1646-7,,,14,Parasitology; Tropical Medicine,Parasitology; Tropical Medicine,DP9RS,WOS:000378835100001,27357295,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2020-12-20,

FALCIPARUM; HUMANS; TRANSMISSION; SULAWESI; SABAH; POPULATION,"Background: Plasmodium knowlesi is a zoonotic pathogen, transmitted among macaques and to humans by anopheline mosquitoes. Information on P. knowlesi malaria is lacking in most regions so the first step to understand the geographical distribution of disease risk is to define the distributions of the reservoir and vector species. Methods: We used macaque and mosquito species presence data, background data that captured sampling bias in the presence data, a boosted regression tree model and environmental datasets, including annual data for land classes, to predict the distributions of each vector and host species. We then compared the predicted distribution of each species with cover of each land class. Results: Fine-scale distribution maps were generated for three macaque host species (Macaca fascicularis, M. nemestrina and M. leonina) and two mosquito vector complexes (the Dirus Complex and the Leucosphyrus Complex). The Leucosphyrus Complex was predicted to occur in areas with disturbed, but not intact, forest cover (> 60 % tree cover) whereas the Dirus Complex was predicted to occur in areas with 10-100 % tree cover as well as vegetation mosaics and cropland. Of the macaque species, M. nemestrina was mainly predicted to occur in forested areas whereas M. fascicularis was predicted to occur in vegetation mosaics, cropland, wetland and urban areas in addition to forested areas. Conclusions: The predicted M. fascicularis distribution encompassed a wide range of habitats where humans are found. This is of most significance in the northern part of its range where members of the Dirus Complex are the main P. knowlesi vectors because these mosquitoes were also predicted to occur in a wider range of habitats. Our results support the hypothesis that conversion of intact forest into disturbed forest (for example plantations or timber concessions), or the creation of vegetation mosaics, will increase the probability that members of the Leucosphyrus Complex occur at these locations, as well as bringing humans into these areas. An explicit analysis of disease risk itself using infection data is required to explore this further. The species distributions generated here can now be included in future analyses of P. knowlesi infection risk.","[Moyes, Catherine L.; Shearer, Freya M.; Wiebe, Antoinette; Golding, Nick] Univ Oxford, Li Ka Shing Ctr Hlth Informat & Discovery, Big Data Inst, Spatial Ecol & Epidemiol Grp, Oxford OX3 7BN, England; [Huang, Zhi; Gibson, Harry S.; Sinka, Marianne E.; Weiss, Daniel J.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Spatial Ecol & Epidemiol Grp, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [Nijman, Vincent] Oxford Brookes Univ, Dept Social Sci, Oxford OX1 0BP, England; [Mohd-Azlan, Jayasilan] Univ Malaysia Sarawak, Fac Resource Sci & Technol, Dept Zool, Kota Samarahan 94300, Sarawak, Malaysia; [Brodie, Jedediah F.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, 6270 Univ Blvd, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Brodie, Jedediah F.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Bot, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Brodie, Jedediah F.] Univ British Columbia, Biodivers Res Ctr, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Malaivijitnond, Suchinda] Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Primate Res Unit, Bangkok 10330, Thailand; [Linkie, Matthew] Fauna & Flora Int, Singapore 247672, Singapore; [Samejima, Hiromitsu] Inst Global Environm Strategies, Kamiyamaguchi 2108-11, Hayama, Kanagawa 2400115, Japan; [O'Brien, Timothy G.; Kinnaird, Margaret F.] Mpala Res Ctr, Wildlife Conservat Soc, Nanyuki 10400, Kenya; [Trainor, Colin R.] Charles Darwin Univ, Res Inst Environm & Livelihoods, Darwin, NT 0909, Australia; [Trainor, Colin R.] Federat Univ Australia, Fac Sci & Technol, Mt Helen, Vic 3350, Australia; [Hamada, Yuzuru] Kyoto Univ, Primate Res Inst, Evolutionary Morphol Sect, Inuyama, Aichi 484, Japan; [Giordano, Anthony J.] SPECIES, Field Conservat Program, Ventura, CA USA; [Giordano, Anthony J.] Tiger Creek Wildlife Refuge, Conservat Sci Program, Tyler, TX USA; [Elyazar, Iqbal R.

The consequences may result in the appearance and rise of mosquito-borne diseases, especially in remote tropical regions. Tropical regions can be the hotspots for the emergence of diseases due to high biological diversity and complex species interactions. Furthermore, frontier areas are often haphazardly surveyed as a result of inadequate or expensive sampling techniques, which limit early detection and medical intervention. We trialed a novel sampling technique of nonpowered traps and a carbon dioxide attractant derived from yeast and sugar to explore how land use influences mosquito communities on four remote, tropical islands in the Australian Torres Strait. Using this technique, we collected > 11,000 mosquitoes from urban and sylvan habitats. We found that human land use significantly affected mosquito communities. Mosquito abundances and diversity were higher in sylvan habitats compared with urban areas, resulting in significantly different community compositions between the two habitats. An important outcome of our study was determining that there were greater numbers of disease-vectoring species associated with human habitations. On the basis of these findings, we believe that our novel sampling technique is a realistic tool for assessing mosquito communities in remote regions.","[Steiger, Dagmar B.

Birds harbor many types of blood parasites, but because of their relatively high prevalence and ease of diagnosis, it is the haemosporidians - Plasmodium, Haemoproteus, and Leucocytozoon - that are the best studied in terms of ecology and evolution. For parasite transmission to occur, environmental conditions must be permissive, and given the many constraints on the competency of parasites, vectors and hosts, it is rather remarkable that these parasites are so prevalent and successful. Over the last decade, a rapidly growing body of literature has begun to clarify how environmental factors affect birds and the insects that vector their hematozoan parasites. Moreover, several studies have modeled how anthropogenic effects such as global climate change, deforestation and urbanization will impact the dynamics of parasite transmission. This review highlights recent research that impacts our understanding of how habitat and environmental changes can affect the distribution, diversity, prevalence and parasitemia of these avian blood parasites. Given the importance of environmental factors on transmission, it remains essential that researchers studying avian hematozoa document abiotic factors such as temperature, moisture and landscape elements. Ultimately, this continued research has the potential to inform conservation policies and help avert the loss of bird species and threatened habitats. (C) 2015 The Author.

Parasite prevalence in mosquitoes is highly age-dependent, and the unknown age-structure of fluctuating mosquito populations impedes estimation. Here, we simulate mosquito infection dynamics, where mosquito recruitment is modelled seasonally with fractional Brownian noise, and we develop methods for estimating mosquito infection rates. We find that noise introduces bias, but the magnitude of the bias depends on the 'colour' of the noise. Some of these problems can be overcome by increasing the sampling frequency, but estimates of transmission rates (and estimated reductions in transmission) are most accurate and precise if they combine parity, oocyst rates and sporozoite rates. These studies provide a basis for evaluating the adequacy of various entomological sampling procedures for measuring malaria parasite transmission from humans to mosquitoes and for evaluating the direct transmission-blocking effects of a vaccine.","[Reiner, Robert C., Jr.; Smith, David L.] NIH, Fogarty Int Ctr, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Reiner, Robert C., Jr.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Reiner, Robert C., Jr.] Indiana Univ, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Bloomington, IN USA; [Guerra, Carlos] Ctr Dis Dynam Econ & Policy, Washington, DC USA; [Donnelly, Martin J.] Univ Liverpool, Liverpool Sch Trop Med, Dept Vector Biol, Liverpool L3 5QA, Merseyside, England; [Donnelly, Martin J.] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Malaria Programme, Cambridge, England; [Bousema, Teun; Drakeley, Chris] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Immunol & Infect, London WC1, England; [Bousema, Teun] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Med Ctr, Dept Med Microbiol, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Smith, David L.] Sanaria Inst Global Hlth & Trop Med, Rockville, MD USA; [Smith, David L.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [Smith, David L.] Univ Washington, Inst Hlth Metr & Evaluat, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Reiner, RC (corresponding author), NIH, Fogarty Int Ctr, Bldg 10, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",rcreiner@indiana.edu,"Smith, David L/L-8850-2013; Bousema, Teun/N-3574-2014","Smith, David L/0000-0003-4367-3849; Bousema, Teun/0000-0003-2666-094X; Donnelly, Martin/0000-0001-5218-1497","Malaria Vaccine Initiative; Research and Policy for Infectious Disease Dynamics (RAPIDD) programme of the Science and Technology Directorate; Department of Homeland SecurityUnited States Department of Homeland Security (DHS); Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC); Bill & Melinda Gates FoundationBill & Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1110495, OPP1034789]; National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious DiseasesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [U19AI089674]; European Research CouncilEuropean Research Council (ERC) [ERC-2014-StG 639776]; NATIONAL CENTER FOR ADVANCING TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) [UL1TR001108, UL1TR002529, UL1TR001108, UL1TR001108, UL1TR001108, UL1TR001108, UL1TR001108, UL1TR001108] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674, U19AI089674] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","R.C.R. and D.L.S. acknowledge funding from the Malaria Vaccine Initiative and from the Research and Policy for Infectious Disease Dynamics (RAPIDD) programme of the Science and Technology Directorate, Department of Homeland Security, and the Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health as well as funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (grant no.

We compared vector abundance and species composition at two forest edge sites abutting pastureland and two forest interior sites in New Zealand, while simultaneously assessing avian malaria prevalence in silvereyes (Zosterops lateralis). Twenty-two of 240 (9.2%) individual silvereyes captured across all sites tested positive for avian malaria, and Plasmodium prevalence was nearly identical in edge and interior habitats. A total of 580 mosquito specimens were trapped across all sites. These comprised five different species: the introduced Aedes notoscriptus and Culex quinquefasciatus; the native A. antipodeus, C. asteliae and C. pervigilans. The known avian malaria vector C. quinquefasciatus was only recorded in the forest edge (mostly at ground level). In contrast, the probable vector C. pervigilans was abundant and widespread in both edge and interior sites. Although frequently caught in ground traps, more C. pervigilans specimens were captured in the canopy. This study shows that avian malaria prevalence among silvereyes appeared to be unaffected by forest fragmentation, at least at the scale assessed. Introduced mosquito species were almost completely absent from the forest interior, and thus our study provides further circumstantial evidence that native mosquito species (in particular C. pervigilans) play an important role in avian malaria transmission in New Zealand.","[Gudex-Cross, David; Barraclough, Rosemary K.; Brunton, Dianne H.] Massey Univ, Inst Nat Sci, Auckland, New Zealand; [Derraik, Jose G.

This is particularly apparent for mosquitoes, which use a combination of olfactory, visual, and thermal cues to locate hosts [6-10]. Mosquitoes are thought to detect suitable hosts by the presence of a sparse CO2 plume, which they track by surging upwind and casting crosswind [11]. Upon approach, local cues such as heat and skin volatiles help them identify a landing site [12-15]. Recent evidence suggests that thermal attraction is gated by the presence of CO2 [6], although this conclusion was based experiments in which the actual flight trajectories of the animals were unknown and visual cues were not studied. Using a three-dimensional tracking system, we show that rather than gating heat sensing, the detection of CO2 actually activates a strong attraction to visual features. This visual reflex guides the mosquitoes to potential hosts where they are close enough to detect thermal cues. By experimentally decoupling the olfactory, visual, and thermal cues, we show that the motor reactions to these stimuli are independently controlled. Given that humans become visible to mosquitoes at a distance of 5-15 m [16], visual cues play a critical intermediate role in host localization by coupling long-range plume tracking to behaviors that require short-range cues. Rather than direct neural coupling, the separate sensory-motor reflexes are linked as a result of the interaction between the animal's reactions and the spatial structure of the stimuli in the environment.","[van Breugel, Floris; Dickinson, Michael H.] CALTECH, Div Biol & Bioengn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Riffell, Jeff] Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Fairhall, Adrienne] Univ Washington, Dept Biophys, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","van Breugel, F (corresponding author), CALTECH, Div Biol & Bioengn, 1200 East Calif Blvd, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",floris@caltech.edu; flyman@caltech.edu,,,"NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [NIH1RO1DCO13693-01]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DEAFNESS AND OTHER COMMUNICATION DISORDERSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) [R01DC013693, R01DC013693, R01DC013693, R01DC013693, R01DC013693] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We thank A.

Rich terrestrial and aquatic species communities are found throughout Neotropical forests, habitats increasingly threatened by land management practices. Plant-held waters, phytotelmata, are ecologically important discrete microhabitats harboring many specialist invertebrates and are abundant in tropical forests. In this study, using artificial tree holes, we examined invertebrate tree hole communities in a mature forest of Los Tuxtlas and in a managed habitat adjacent to the Los Tuxtlas Biological Station. Based on the proximity of human and livestock communities to managed habitats and the dispersal limitations of some phytotelmata specialists, we expected to find community composition differences between the two habitats. We found distinct differences in chironomid colonization; Tanypodinae, a predaceous subfamily, was present in the managed habitat and its omnivorous counterpart, Chironominae, was present in the forest. We found differences in mosquito colonization with more predaceous Toxorhychites in the managed habitat. Haemagogus mosquitoes were only present in the managed habitat. These results indicate different colonization ability across phytotelmata specialists and warn of larger community shifts and potential public health hazards with continued and intensified forest fragmentation and degradation.","[Khazan, Emily S.; Bright, Eric G.; Beyer, Jessica E.] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Biol, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Khazan, Emily S.] Cano Palma Biol Stn, Pococi, Limon, Costa Rica; [Bright, Eric G.] Oklahoma Biol Survey, Norman, OK 73019 USA","Khazan, ES (corresponding author), Univ Oklahoma, Dept Biol, 730 Van Vleet Oval,Room 314, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",ekhazan@gmail.com,,"Beyer, Jessica/0000-0002-3388-3255",OU Department of Biology; OU College of Arts and Sciences,"Thanks to R.

In this study, we analyse the relationship between environmental variables estimated by remote sensing and the spatial distribution (presence, abundance and diversity) of seven mosquito species vectors of West Nile and other pathogens (Usutu, avian malaria and dirofilariasis) in the Donana Natural Park, Spain. Traps were distributed over an area of 54,984 ha divided into six ecological units: marshland, sand dunes, scrubland, ricefields, crops and fishponds. We collected mosquitoes once a month from up to 112 locations using BG-Sentinel traps baited with BG-lure and CO2 during March-November 2010. Hydroperiod, NDVI and Inundation surface were estimated at several resolution scales (100, 250, 500, 1000 and 2000 metres) from corrected and normalized Landsat Images. We sampled 972,346 female mosquitoes, the most abundant species being Culex theileri, Ochlerotatus caspius, Culex modestus, Culex perexiguus, Culex pipiens, Anopheles atroparvus and Ochlerotatus detritus. Our results suggest that: (1) hydroperiod, inundation surface and NDVI are strongly related to the spatial distribution of mosquitoes; (2) the spatial scales used to measure these variables affected quantification of these relationships, the larger scale being more informative; (3) these relationships are species-specific; (4) hydroperiod is negatively related to mosquito presence and richness; (5) Culex abundance is positively related to hydroperiod; (6) NDVI is positively related to mosquito diversity, presence and abundance, except in the case of the two salt marsh species (Oc. caspius and Oc. detritus); and (7) inundation surfaces positively condition the abundance and richness of most species except the salt marsh mosquitoes. Remote sensing data provided reliable information for monitoring mosquito populations. Landscape significantly affected mosquito distribution and abundance, and as a result may alter disease risk. These results suggest that while environmental conditions affect the distribution and abundance of mosquitoes, other factors such as human modification of landscapes may give rise to significant changes in mosquito populations and consequently disease risk.","[Roiz, David; Soriguer, Ramon; Figuerola, Jordi] CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, Seville 41092, Spain; [Ruiz, Santiago] Serv Control Mosquitos, Area Medio Ambiente, Huelva, Spain","Roiz, D (corresponding author), IRD, MIVEGEC Infect Dis & Vectors Ecol Genet Evolut &, UMR IRD224 CNRS5290 UM, 911 Ave Agropolis,BP 64501, F-34394 Montpellier 5, France.",davidroiz@gmail.com,"Figuerola, Jordi/B-7917-2008; Roiz, David/F-2082-2011; Soriguer, Ramon/J-1494-2014","Figuerola, Jordi/0000-0002-4664-9011; Roiz, David/0000-0002-5819-3648; Soriguer, Ramon/0000-0002-9165-7766","Junta de AndaluciaJunta de Andalucia [P07-RNM-02511, RNM118, RNM157]; European Commission EuroWestNile EU grant [261391, HEALTH.2010.2.3.3-3]; EDENext FP7 project [EDENext 344]","This work was partially supported by the Junta de Andalucia projects P07-RNM-02511, RNM118, RNM157, and European Commission EuroWestNile EU grant HEALTH. 2010.2.3.3-3 Project 261391, and the EDENext FP7 project, publication number EDENext 344.",,49,34,34,3,46,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,JUN 18,2015,10,6,,,,,,,e0128112,10.1371/journal.pone.0128112,,,17,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,CK9NT,WOS:000356567500014,26086804,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2020-12-20,

The bromeliad-malaria paradigm assumes that transmission of Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium malariae involves species of the subgenus Kerteszia of Anopheles and only a few cases of Plasmodium vivax malaria are reported annually in this region. The expectations of this paradigm are a low prevalence of Plasmodium vivax and a null prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum. Therefore, the aim of this study was to verify if Plasmodium falciparum is actively circulating in the southeastern Brazilian Atlantic forest remains. Methods: In this study, anophelines were collected with Shannon and CDC-light traps in seven distinct Atlantic forest landscapes over a 4-month period. Field-collected Anopheles mosquitoes were tested by real-time PCR assay in pools of ten, and then each mosquito from every positive pool, separately for Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. Genomic DNA of Plasmodium falciparum or Plasmodium vivax from positive anophelines was then amplified by traditional PCR for sequencing of the 18S ribosomal DNA to confirm Plasmodium species. Binomial probabilities were calculated to identify non-random results of the Plasmodium falciparum-infected anopheline findings. Results: The overall proportion of anophelines naturally infected with Plasmodium falciparum was 4.4% (21/480) and only 0.8% (4/480) with Plasmodium vivax. All of the infected mosquitoes were found in intermixed natural and human-modified environments and most were Anopheles cruzii (22/25 = 88%, 18 Plasmodium falciparum plus 4 Plasmodium vivax). Plasmodium falciparum was confirmed by sequencing in 76% (16/21) of positive mosquitoes, whereas Plasmodium vivax was confirmed in only 25% (1/4). Binomial probabilities suggest that Plasmodium falciparum actively circulates throughout the region and that there may be a threshold of the forested over human-modified environment ratio upon which the proportion of Plasmodium falciparum-infected anophelines increases significantly. Conclusions: These results show that Plasmodium falciparum actively circulates, in higher proportion than Plasmodium vivax, among Anopheles mosquitoes of fragments of the southeastern Brazilian Atlantic forest. This finding challenges the classical bromeliad-malaria paradigm, which considers Plasmodium vivax circulation as the driver for the dynamics of residual malaria transmission in this region.","[Laporta, Gabriel Zorello; Porangaba de Oliveira, Tatiane Marques; Mureb Sallum, Maria Anice] Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Saude Publ, Dept Epidemiol, BR-01246904 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Laporta, Gabriel Zorello; Burattini, Marcelo Nascimento; Massad, Eduardo] Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Med, Lab Informat Med LIM 01, BR-05405000 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Burattini, Marcelo Nascimento] Univ Fed Sao Paulo, Escola Paulista Med, Hosp Sao Paulo, Div Doencas Infecc, BR-04024002 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Levy, Debora; Ferreira Maselli, Luciana Morganti; Bydlowski, Sergio Paulo] Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Med, Lab Genet & Hematol Mol LIM 31, BR-05403000 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Fukuya, Linah Akemi; Ferreira Maselli, Luciana Morganti] Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Med, Fundacao Prosangue Hemoctr Sao Paulo, Divisao Pesquisa, BR-05403000 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Conn, Jan Evelyn] Wadsworth Ctr, Dept Hlth, Slingerlands, NY 12159 USA; [Conn, Jan Evelyn] SUNY Albany, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biomed Sci, Albany, NY 12222 USA","Laporta, GZ (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Saude Publ, Dept Epidemiol, BR-01246904 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.",gabrielzorelo@usp.br,"Burattini, Marcelo N/J-9272-2014; Massad, Eduardo/B-1169-2012; Sallum, Maria Anice Mureb/B-8537-2012; Laporta, Gabriel/B-8662-2012; Levy, Debora/G-8208-2014; Laporta, Gabriel/P-3621-2019","Burattini, Marcelo N/0000-0002-5407-6890; Massad, Eduardo/0000-0002-7200-2916; Sallum, Maria Anice Mureb/0000-0002-7051-2891; Laporta, Gabriel/0000-0001-7412-9390; Levy, Debora/0000-0001-7492-997X; Laporta, Gabriel/0000-0001-7412-9390; Conn, Jan/0000-0002-5301-7020","Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2011/20397-7]; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [301666/2011-3]; FAPESPFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2009/53141-5, 2012/09939-5, 2014/09774-1]; CNPqNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)","We are in debited to Marcelo Jacobs-Lorena for providing Anopheles mosquitoes infected with Plasmodium; Marcelo Urbano Ferreira for Plasmodium samples used as positive controls for the PCRs; financial support from Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP Grant 2011/20397-7) and Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq no. 301666/2011-3) to MAMS; financial support from FAPESP (Grant 2009/53141-5) and CNPq to SBP.

The vast majority of endogenous small RNAs produced by the siRNA and piRNA pathways originate from repetitive or transposable elements (TE). In D. melanogaster, TE-derived endogenous siRNAs and piRNAs are involved in genome surveillance and maintenance of genome integrity. In the medically relevant malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae TEs constitute 12-16% of the genome size. Genetic variations induced by TE activities are known to shape the genome landscape and to alter the fitness in An. gambiae. Results: Here, using bioinformatics approaches we analyzed the small RNA data sets from 6 libraries formally reported in a previous study and examined the expression of the mixed germline/somatic siRNAs and piRNAs produced in adult An. gambiae females. We characterized a large population of TE-derived endogenous siRNAs and piRNAs, which constitutes 56-60% of the total siRNA and piRNA reads in the analysed libraries. Moreover, we identified a number of protein coding genes producing gene-specific siRNAs and piRNAs that were generally expressed at much lower levels than the TE-associated small RNAs. Detailed sequence analysis revealed that An. gambiae piRNAs were produced by both ping-pong dependent (TE-associated piRNAs) and independent mechanisms (genic piRNAs). Similarly to D. melanogaster, more than 90% of the detected piRNAs were produced from TE-associated clusters in An. gambiae. We also found that biotic stress as blood feeding and infection with Plasmodium parasite, the etiological agent of malaria, modulated the expression levels of the endogenous siRNAs and piRNAs in An. gambiae. Conclusions: We identified a large and diverse set of the endogenously derived siRNAs and piRNAs that share common and distinct aspects of small RNA expression across insect species, and inferred their impact on TE and gene activity in An. gambiae. The TE-specific small RNAs produced by both the siRNA and piRNA pathways represent an important aspect of genome stability and genetic variation, which might have a strong impact on the evolution of the genome and vector competence in the malaria mosquitoes.","[Biryukova, Inna] MPIIB, Dept Vector Biol, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Ye, Tao] IGBMC, Microarrays & Deep Sequencing Platform, F-67404 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France","Biryukova, I (corresponding author), MPIIB, Dept Vector Biol, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",inbiryukova@gmail.com,,,"FG National Infrastructure, Investissements d'Avenir programFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-10-INBS-0009]; European CommunityEuropean Community (EC) [242095-EVIMalar, 223601-MALVECBLOK]","We thank E.

As a result, implementing sustainable infectious disease surveillance systems in these regions is challenging. The cost of these programs and difficulties associated with collecting, storing and transporting relevant samples have hindered them in the regions where they are most needed. Therefore, we tested the sensitivity and feasibility of a novel surveillance technique called xenosurveillance. This approach utilizes the host feeding preferences and behaviors of Anopheles gambiae, which are highly anthropophilic and rest indoors after feeding, to sample viruses in human beings. We hypothesized that mosquito bloodmeals could be used to detect vertebrate viral pathogens within realistic field collection timeframes and clinically relevant concentrations. Methodology/Principal Findings To validate this approach, we examined variables influencing virus detection such as the duration between mosquito blood feeding and mosquito processing, the pathogen nucleic acid stability in the mosquito gut and the pathogen load present in the host's blood at the time of bloodmeal ingestion using our laboratory model. Our findings revealed that viral nucleic acids, at clinically relevant concentrations, could be detected from engorged mosquitoes for up to 24 hours post feeding by qRT-PCR. Subsequently, we tested this approach in the field by examining blood from engorged mosquitoes from two field sites in Liberia. Using next-generation sequencing and PCR we were able to detect the genetic signatures of multiple viral pathogens including Epstein-Barr virus and canine distemper virus. Conclusions/Significance Together, these data demonstrate the feasibility of xenosurveillance and in doing so validated a simple and non-invasive surveillance tool that could be used to complement current biosurveillance efforts.","[Grubaugh, Nathan D.; Krajacich, Benjamin J.; Ebel, Gregory D.; Foy, Brian D.; Brackney, Doug E.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Microbiol Immunol & Pathol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Sharma, Supriya; Johnson, W.

However, the reproductive strategies that the sexes adopt often have the potential to give rise to sexual conflict because they can result in divergent, sex-specific costs and benefits. These conflicts can occur at many levels, from molecular to behavioral. Here, we consider sexual conflict mediated through the actions of seminal fluid proteins. These proteins provide many excellent examples in which to trace the operation of sexual conflict from molecules through to behavior. Seminal fluid proteins are made by males and provided to females during mating. As agents that can modulate egg production at several steps, as well as reproductive behavior, sperm management, and female feeding, activity, and longevity, the actions of seminal proteins are prime targets for sexual conflict. We review these actions in the context of sexual conflict. We discuss genomic signatures in seminal protein (and related) genes that are consistent with current or previous sexual conflict. Finally, we note promising areas for future study and highlight real-world practical situations that will benefit from understanding the nature of sexual conflicts mediated by seminal proteins.","[Sirot, Laura K.] Coll Wooster, Dept Biol, Wooster, OH 44691 USA; [Wong, Alex] Carleton Univ, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; [Chapman, Tracey] Univ E Anglia, Sch Biol Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Wolfner, Mariana F.] Cornell Univ, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Wolfner, MF (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",tracey.chapman@uea.ac.uk; mfw5@cornell.edu,"Chapman, Tracey/E-5100-2011",,"National Institutes of Health (NIH)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01-HD038921, R01-HD059060, R01-AI095491]; Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)NERC Natural Environment Research Council; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) grants; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) Discovery GrantNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENTUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [R01HD038921, R01HD059060, R01HD038921, R01HD059060, R01HD038921, R01HD059060, R01HD059060, R01HD038921, R01HD059060, R01HD038921, R01HD059060, R01HD038921, R01HD038921, R01HD059060, R01HD059060, R01HD059060, R01HD059060, R01HD038921] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH &HUMAN DEVELOPMENTUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [R01HD059060, R01HD059060, R01HD038921, R01HD038921, R01HD038921, R01HD038921, R01HD038921, R01HD038921, R01HD038921, R01HD038921, R01HD038921, R01HD038921, R01HD038921, R01HD038921, R01HD038921, R01HD038921, R01HD038921] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R01AI095491, R01AI095491, R01AI095491, R01AI095491, R01AI095491, R01AI095491, R01AI095491, R01AI095491] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We are grateful to Bill Rice, Larry Harshman, and two anonymous reviewers for valuable comments on this article and to Bill Rice and Sergei Gavrilets for the opportunity to write it.

In the present work we investigated co-occurrence or spatial segregation in mosquito assemblages sharing resources at micro-habitat, habitat and landscape scales. Environmental characteristics, mosquito fauna as adults and larvae were assessed along vegetation gradient in a natural landscape of tropical rainforest. Huisman-Olff-Fresco (HOF) and Generalized Additive (GAM) models were employed to explore relationships between abundances of potential competitors in mosquito assemblages and vegetation gradient (e.g., scrublands, mixed arboreal vegetation and dense ombrophilous forest). We tested hypotheses concerning mosquito species co-occurrence or spatial segregation employing binomial logistic regression models. Results: Co-occurrences and spatial segregation of mosquito species showed evidences of three scales of coexistence mechanisms: 1) micro-habitat - scale 1: different behaviors in response to food availability in specific vertical strata within larval container; 2) habitat - scale 2: specialized strategies related to heterogeneity of resource availability among larval containers and 3) landscape - scale 3: asymmetrical competition dependent upon the context of abiotic and biotic variables. Conclusion: Results of the present work suggest that coexistence mechanisms can concomitantly work at multiple scales.","[Laporta, Gabriel Zorello; Sallum, Maria Anice Mureb] Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Saude Publ, Dept Epidemiol, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Laporta, Gabriel Zorello] Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Saude Publ, Lab Informat Med LIM 01, Sao Paulo, Brazil","Laporta, GZ (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Saude Publ, Dept Epidemiol, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",gabrielzorelo@usp.br,"Sallum, Maria Anice Mureb/B-8537-2012; Laporta, Gabriel/P-3621-2019; Laporta, Gabriel/B-8662-2012","Sallum, Maria Anice Mureb/0000-0002-7051-2891; Laporta, Gabriel/0000-0001-7412-9390; Laporta, Gabriel/0000-0001-7412-9390",Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa no Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2012/09939-5]; FAPESPFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2011/20397-7]; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [301666/2011-3],"We are in debt with Dr. Paulo Inacio K.

Little is known about their biology on a molecular-genetic level, including components of their immune system. Because the insect immune response is involved with important processes such as gut microbial homeostasis and vector competence, our aims were to identify components of the midge innate immune system and examine their expression profiles in response to diet across time. Methods: In our previous work, we de novo sequenced and analyzed the transcriptional landscape of female midges under several feeding states including teneral (unfed) and early and late time points after blood and sucrose. Here, those transcriptomes were further analyzed to identify insect innate immune orthologs, particularly humoral immune response elements. Additionally, we examined immune gene expression profiles in response to diet over time, on both a transcriptome-wide, whole-midge level and more specifically via qRTPCR analysis of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) expression in the alimentary canal. Results: We identified functional units comprising the immune deficiency (Imd), Toll and JAK/STAT pathways, including humoral factors, transmembrane receptors, signaling components, transcription factors/regulators and effectors such as AMPs. Feeding altered the expression of receptors, regulators, AMPs, prophenoloxidase and thioester-containing proteins, where blood had a greater effect than sucrose on the expression profiles of most innate immune components. qRTPCR of AMP genes showed that all five were significantly upregulated in the alimentary canal after blood feeding, possibly in response to proliferating populations of gut bacteria. Conclusions: Identification and functional insight of humoral/innate immune components in female C. sonorensis updates our knowledge of the molecular biology of this important vector. Because diet alone influenced the expression of immune pathway components, including their effectors, subsequent study of the role of innate immunity in biological processes such as gut homeostasis and life history are being pursued. Furthermore, since the humoral response is a key contributor in gut immunity, manipulating immune gene expression will help in uncovering genetic components of vector competence, including midgut barriers to infection. The results of such studies will serve as a platform for designing novel transmission-blocking strategies.","[Nayduch, Dana; Lee, Matthew B.] USDA ARS, Ctr Grain & Anim Hlth Res, Arthropod Borne Anim Dis Res Unit, Manhattan, KS 66502 USA; [Saski, Christopher A.] Clemson Univ, Genom & Computat Biol Lab, Inst Translat Genom, Clemson, SC 29634 USA","Nayduch, D (corresponding author), USDA ARS, Ctr Grain & Anim Hlth Res, Arthropod Borne Anim Dis Res Unit, 1515 Coll Ave, Manhattan, KS 66502 USA.",dana.nayduch@ars.usda.gov,,,"U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research ServiceUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA); National Program 104: Veterinary, Medical and Urban Entomology [5430-32000-003]; Clemson University [58-5430-2-313]","DN and MBL would like to thank J.

These histone profiles were then correlated with levels of gene expression obtained by RNA-seq. Analysis of the transcriptome of A. gambiae midguts and salivary glands led to the discovery of 13,898 new transcripts not present in the most recent genome assembly. A subset of these transcripts is differentially expressed between midgut and salivary glands. The enrichment profiles of H3K27ac and H3K27me3 are mutually exclusive and associate with high and low levels of transcription, respectively. This distribution agrees with previous findings in Drosophila showing association of these two histone modifications with either active or inactive transcriptional states, including Polycomb-associated domains in silenced genes.

Although infection is preventable through prophylactic drugs, compliance and the spectre of resistance suggest vector control is a viable alternative. There were two main objectives in this study: (a) to evaluate the relationships between landscape and social factors and the number and species of heartworm-positive mosquitoes, with a specific focus on the importance of the invasive Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus (Skuse) (Stegomyia albopicta) (Diptera: Culicidae), and (b) to test the hypothesis that dog heartworm is more prevalent in suburban than in rural areas. To achieve these objectives, mosquitoes were collected from May to November 2010 at 16 rural and 16 urban locations in Payne County, Oklahoma, U. S. A. using three trapping methods that utilized, respectively, resting boxes, carbon dioxide traps and BG Sentinel traps. Urban areas showed greater numbers of Ae. albopictus and a higher overall likelihood of infection with D. immitis. Because many species of mosquito are responsible for heartworm transmission, current prophylactic treatment remains the best method of controlling this parasite.","[Paras, K. L.; O'Brien, V.

FALCIPARUM; HUMANS; MOSQUITOS; MACAQUES; VECTORS; SARAWAK; NETS,"Introduction: Plasmodium knowlesi is now recognised as a leading cause of malaria in Malaysia. As humans come into increasing contact with the reservoir host (long-tailed macaques) as a consequence of deforestation, assessing the potential for a shift from zoonotic to sustained P. knowlesi transmission between humans is critical. Methods: A multi-host, multi-site transmission model was developed, taking into account the three areas (forest, farm, and village) where transmission is thought to occur. Latin hypercube sampling of model parameters was used to identify parameter sets consistent with possible prevalence in macaques and humans inferred from observed data. We then explore the consequences of increasing human-macaque contact in the farm, the likely impact of rapid treatment, and the use of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) in preventing wider spread of this emerging infection. Results: Identified model parameters were consistent with transmission being sustained by themacaques with spill over infections into the human population and with high overall basic reproduction numbers (up to 2267). The extent to which macaques forage in the farms had a non-linear relationship with human infection prevalence, the highest prevalence occurring when macaques forage in the farms but return frequently to the forest where they experience higher contact with vectors and hence sustain transmission. Only one of 1,046 parameter sets was consistent with sustained human-to-human transmission in the absence of macaques, although with a low human reproduction number (R-0H = 1.04). Simulations showed LLINs and rapid treatment provide personal protection to humans with maximal estimated reductions in human prevalence of 42% and 95%, respectively. Conclusion: This model simulates conditions where P. knowlesi transmission may occur and the potential impact of control measures. Predictions suggest that conventional control measures are sufficient at reducing the risk of infection in humans, but they must be actively implemented if P. knowlesi is to be controlled.","[Imai, Natsuko; Drakeley, Chris J.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Immunol & Infect, London WC1, England; [Imai, Natsuko; White, Michael T.; Ghani, Azra C.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, MRC Ctr Outbreak Anal & Modelling, London, England","Imai, N (corresponding author), London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Immunol & Infect, London WC1, England.",n.imai12@imperial.ac.uk,"Imai, Natsuko/J-5817-2017; Ghani, Azra/B-8560-2009; Singh, Balbir/A-3610-2009","Imai, Natsuko/0000-0002-4218-9716; Ghani, Azra/0000-0002-0007-4910; White, Michael/0000-0002-7472-4138","Medical Research CouncilMedical Research Council UK (MRC) [G1100796]; Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council; Economic and Social Research CouncilEconomic & Social Research Council (ESRC); Biotechnology and Biosciences Research Council through the Environmental & Social Ecology of Human Infectious Diseases Initiative (ESEI) [G1100796]; Medical Research CouncilMedical Research Council UK (MRC) [MR/K010174/1, MR/K010174/1B] Funding Source: researchfish","This work was supported in part by a grant (G1100796) from the Medical Research Council, Natural Environment Research Council, Economic and Social Research Council, and Biotechnology and Biosciences Research Council for the funding received for this project through the Environmental & Social Ecology of Human Infectious Diseases Initiative (ESEI) to CJD (G1100796).

Predicting areas at high risk for disease transmission requires an accurate model of vector distribution, however, most Cx. pipiens distribution modeling has been confined to temperate, forested habitats. Modeling species distributions across a heterogeneous landscape structure requires a flexible modeling method to capture variation in mosquito response to predictors as well as occurrence data points taken from a sufficient range of habitat types. Methods: We used presence-only data from Egypt and Lebanon to model the population distribution of Cx. pipiens across a portion of the MENA that also encompasses Jordan, Syria, and Israel. Models were created with a set of environmental predictors including bioclimatic data, human population density, hydrological data, and vegetation indices, and built using maximum entropy (Maxent) and boosted regression tree (BRT) methods. Models were created with and without the inclusion of human population density. Results: Predictions of Maxent and BRT models were strongly correlated in habitats with high probability of occurrence (Pearson's r = 0.774, r = 0.734), and more moderately correlated when predicting into regions that exceeded the range of the training data (r = 0.666, r = 0.558). All models agreed in predicting high probability of occupancy around major urban areas, along the banks of the Nile, the valleys of Israel, Lebanon, and Jordan, and southwestern Saudi Arabia. The most powerful predictors of Cx. pipiens habitat were human population density (60.6% Maxent models, 34.9% BRT models) and the seasonality of the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) (44.7% Maxent, 16.3% BRT). Maxent models tended to be dominated by a single predictor. Areas of high probability corresponded with sites of independent surveys or previous disease outbreaks. Conclusions: Cx. pipiens occurrence was positively associated with areas of high human population density and consistent vegetation cover, but was not significantly driven by temperature and rainfall, suggesting human-induced habitat change such as irrigation and urban infrastructure has a greater influence on vector distribution in this region than in temperate zones.","[Conley, Amy K.] Univ Miami, Dept Geog, Coral Gables, FL 33146 USA; [Fuller, Douglas O.] Univ Miami, Coll Arts & Sci, Miami, FL USA; [Haddad, Nabil] Lebanese Univ, Fac Publ Hlth, Immunol Lab, Fanar, El Metn, Lebanon; [Hassan, Ali N.] Ain Shams Univ, Inst Environm Studies & Res, Dept Basic Environm Sci, Cairo, Egypt; [Gad, Adel M.] Ain Shams Univ, Dept Entomol, Cairo, Egypt; [Beier, John C.] Univ Miami, Miller Sch Med, Dept Publ Hlth Sci, Miami, FL 33136 USA","Conley, AK (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Dept Geog, 1300 Campo Sano Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33146 USA.",,"Hassan, Ali N./ABG-2936-2020","Hassan, Ali N./0000-0002-0514-3743","National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM093345]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM093345, R01GM093345, R01GM093345, R01GM093345, R01GM093345] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",Research reported in this publication was supported by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health under award number R01GM093345.

Thus, the ability to follow host-specific evolutionary trajectories of viruses is essential to predict and prevent epidemics. By studying the spatial and temporal evolution of chikungunya virus during natural transmission between mosquitoes and mammals, we have identified viral evolutionary intermediates prior to emergence. Analysis of virus populations at anatomical barriers revealed that the mosquito midgut and salivary gland pose population bottlenecks. By focusing on virus subpopulations in the saliva of multiple mosquito strains, we recapitulated the emergence of a recent epidemic strain of chikungunya and identified E1 glycoprotein mutations with potential to emerge in the future. These mutations confer fitness advantages in mosquito and mammalian hosts by altering virion stability and fusogenic activity. Thus, virus evolutionary trajectories can be predicted and studied in the short term before new variants displace currently circulating strains.","[Stapleford, Kenneth A.; Borderia, Antonio V.; Rozen-Gagnon, Kathryn; Blanc, Herve; Beaucourt, Stephanie; Vignuzzi, Marco] CNRS, Inst Pasteur, Viral Populat & Pathogenesis Unit, UMR 3569, F-75724 Paris 15, France; [Coffey, Lark L.] Univ Calif Davis, Sch Vet Med, Dept Pathol Microbiol & Immunol, Ctr Vectorborne Dis, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Lay, Sreyrath; Duong, Veasna; Buchy, Philippe] Inst Pasteur, Virol Unit, Phnom Penh, Cambodia; [Isakov, Ofer; Shomron, Noam] Tel Aviv Univ, Sackler Fac Med, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Arias-Goeta, Camilo; Failloux, Anna-Bella] Inst Pasteur, Arboviruses & Insect Vectors Lab, F-75724 Paris 15, France; [Haliloglu, Turkan] Bogazici Univ, Dept Chem Engn, TR-34342 Istanbul, Turkey; [Haliloglu, Turkan] Bogazici Univ, Polymer Res Ctr, TR-34342 Istanbul, Turkey; [Schmitt, Christine; Bonne, Isabelle] Inst Pasteur, F-75724 Paris 15, France; [Ben-Tal, Nir] Tel Aviv Univ, George S Wise Fac Life Sci, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel","Vignuzzi, M (corresponding author), CNRS, Inst Pasteur, Viral Populat & Pathogenesis Unit, UMR 3569, 28 Rue Dr Roux, F-75724 Paris 15, France.",marco.vignuzzi@pasteur.fr,"Veasna, Duong/I-9684-2014","Veasna, Duong/0000-0003-0353-1678; Ben-Tal, Nir/0000-0001-6901-832X; Beaucourt, Stephanie/0000-0001-9394-6425; Vignuzzi, Marco/0000-0002-4400-771X; Stapleford, Kenneth/0000-0002-7796-2254; BUCHY, Philippe/0000-0003-1372-3008; Borderia, Antonio V./0000-0003-0623-1988","European Research Council (ERC Starting Grant)European Research Council (ERC) [242719]; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Grand Challenges Exploration Initiative; French Government's Investissement d'Avenir programFrench National Research Agency (ANR); Laboratoire d'Excellence Integrative Biology of Emerging Infectious Diseases'' [ANR-10-LABX-62-IBEID]; Israel-France High Council for Science and Technology Research Complexity in Biology'' program; Region of Ile-de-France DIM program on Infectious, Parasitic or Nosocomial Emerging Diseases; Philippe Foundation; French National grantFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-09-JCJC-0118-1]; French Ministry of Superior Education and Research; NATO traveling grant [CBP.MD.CLG 984340]","This work was supported by the European Research Council (ERC Starting Grant No. 242719), by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Grand Challenges Exploration Initiative, the French Government's Investissement d'Avenir program, Laboratoire d'Excellence Integrative Biology of Emerging Infectious Diseases'' (grant ANR-10-LABX-62-IBEID), and the Israel-France High Council for Science and Technology Research Complexity in Biology'' program.

Using chikungunya virus (CHIKV) to study adaptation to a mosquito vector, we evaluated mutations associated with recently evolved sub-lineages. Multiple Aedes albopictus-adaptive fitness peaks became available after CHIKV acquired an initial adaptive (E1-A226V) substitution, permitting rapid lineage diversification observed in nature. All second-step mutations involved replacements by glutamine or glutamic acid of E2 glycoprotein amino acids in the acid-sensitive region, providing a framework to anticipate additional A. albopictus-adaptive mutations. The combination of second-step adaptive mutations into a single, 'super-adaptive' fitness peak also predicted the future emergence of CHIKV strains with even greater transmission efficiency in some current regions of endemic circulation, followed by their likely global spread.","[Tsetsarkin, Konstantin A.; Chen, Rubing; Yun, Ruimei; Rossi, Shannan L.; Plante, Kenneth S.; Guerbois, Mathilde; Forrester, Naomi; Leal, Grace; Huang, Jing; Weaver, Scott C.] Univ Texas Med Branch, Inst Human Infect & Immun, Ctr Trop Dis, Dept Pathol, Galveston, TX 77555 USA; [Perng, Guey Chuen] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Emory Vaccine Ctr, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Perng, Guey Chuen] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Coll Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Tainan 70101, Taiwan; [Perng, Guey Chuen] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Ctr Infect Dis & Signaling Res, Tainan 701, Taiwan; [Sreekumar, Easwaran] RGCB, Viral Dis Biol Program, Thiruvananthapuram 695012, Kerala, India; [Mukhopadhyay, Suchetana] Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA","Weaver, SC (corresponding author), Univ Texas Med Branch, Inst Human Infect & Immun, Ctr Trop Dis, Dept Pathol, Galveston, TX 77555 USA.",sweaver@utmb.edu,"Weaver, Scott C/D-6490-2011","Weaver, Scott C/0000-0001-8016-8556; Perng, Oscar/0000-0001-7510-4486","Department of Biotechnology of the Indian government [BT/PR5315/MED/29/476/2012]; NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [AI069145]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R01AI069145, R01AI069145, R01AI069145, R01AI069145] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1157716] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Div Of Molecular and Cellular BioscienceNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1157716] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",We thank Hui-Mien Hsiao for sending sl1 CHIKV samples and Rachy Abraham for assistance in sequencing of the sl4 CHIKV strains.

Lately, a much broader and subtler landscape has emerged: occurrence of tolerance and resistance has been described as a host-regulated immune response. However, little is known about the interplay between the immune response strategy mounted by the insect during infection and the damage produced by the pathogen. Based on the Matzinger model of danger/damage, we propose a quantitative model to explain the occurrence of either resistance or tolerance. We discuss the features to be analyzed and describe the terms of reference by which, with basic models, we distinguish between immune strategies. Pathogen type and mixed infections are also contemplated. We hope this analysis will give new perspective, from an evolutionary ecology standpoint, on immune response measurements in the context of insect infection, and on the importance of (non-self or self) damage.

Chemoreceptor organs on the labella and tarsi are involved in human host evaluation and thus serve as potential foci for the disruption of blood feeding behavior. In addition to host detection, these contact chemoreceptors mediate feeding, oviposition and conspecific recognition; however, the molecular landscape of chemoreception in these tissues remains mostly uncharacterized. Here we report the expression profile of all putative chemoreception genes in the labella and tarsi of both sexes of adult Ae. aegypti and discuss their possible roles in the physiology and behavior of this important disease vector.

Efforts to control these diseases have been underpinned by a theoretical framework developed for malaria by Ross and Macdonald, including models, metrics for measuring transmission, and theory of control that identifies key vulnerabilities in the transmission cycle. That framework, especially Macdonalds formula for R-0 and its entomological derivative, vectorial capacity, are now used to study dynamics and design interventions for many mosquito-borne diseases. A systematic review of 388 models published between 1970 and 2010 found that the vast majority adopted the RossMacdonald assumption of homogeneous transmission in a well-mixed population. Studies comparing models and data question these assumptions and point to the capacity to model heterogeneous, focal transmission as the most important but relatively unexplored component in current theory. Fine-scale heterogeneity causes transmission dynamics to be nonlinear, and poses problems for modeling, epidemiology and measurement. Novel mathematical approaches show how heterogeneity arises from the biology and the landscape on which the processes of mosquito biting and pathogen transmission unfold. Emerging theory focuses attention on the ecological and social context for mosquito blood feeding, the movement of both hosts and mosquitoes, and the relevant spatial scales for measuring transmission and for modeling dynamics and control.","[Smith, David L.; Cummings, Derek A.

Characterizing WNV vector habitat requirements allows for the identification of areas at risk of viral amplification and transmission. Maxent-based ecological niche models were developed using literature records of 13 potential WNV Italian vector mosquito species to predict their habitat suitability range and to investigate possible geographical associations with WNV equine outbreak occurrence in Italy from 2008 to 2010. The contribution of different environmental variables to the niche models was also assessed. Suitable habitats for Culex pipiens, Aedes albopictus, and Anopheles maculipennis were widely distributed; Culex modestus, Ochlerotatus geniculatus, Ochlerotatus caspius, Coquillettidia richiardii, Aedes vexans, and Anopheles plumbeus were concentrated in north-central Italy; Aedes cinereus, Culex theileri, Ochlerotatus dorsalis, and Culiseta longiareolata were restricted to coastal/southern areas. Elevation, temperature, and precipitation variables showed the highest predictive power. Host population and landscape variables provided minor contributions. WNV equine outbreaks had a significantly higher probability to occur in habitats suitable for Cx. modestus and Cx. pipiens, providing circumstantial evidence that the potential distribution of these two species coincides geographically with the observed distribution of the disease in equines.","[Mughini-Gras, Lapo; Busani, Luca] Ist Super Sanita, Dipartimento Sanita Pubbl Vet & Sicurezza Alimen, I-00161 Rome, Italy; [Mughini-Gras, Lapo; Mulatti, Paolo; Montarsi, Fabrizio; Patregnani, Tommaso; Bonfanti, Lebana; Capelli, Gioia] Ist Zooprofilatt Sperimentale Venezie, Padua, Italy; [Severini, Francesco; Boccolini, Daniela; Romi, Roberto; Bongiorno, Gioia; Khoury, Cristina; Bianchi, Riccardo; Rezza, Giovanni] Ist Super Sanita, Dipartimento Malattie Infett Parassitarie & Immun, I-00161 Rome, Italy; [Mughini-Gras, Lapo] Ctr Infect Dis Control CIb, Natl Inst Publ Hlth & Environm RIVM, Epidemiol & Surveillance Unit, NL-3720 BA Bilthoven, Netherlands","Mughini-Gras, L (corresponding author), Ist Super Sanita, Dipartimento Sanita Pubbl Vet & Sicurezza Alimen, Viale Regina Elena 299, I-00161 Rome, Italy.",lapo.mughini.gras@rivm.nl,"rezza, giovanni/D-4393-2016; Busani, Luca/J-9253-2012; Mulatti, Paolo/V-7274-2019","rezza, giovanni/0000-0003-0268-6790; Busani, Luca/0000-0002-6081-2794; Mulatti, Paolo/0000-0001-8188-997X",,,,50,14,15,1,28,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1612-9202,1612-9210,,ECOHEALTH,EcoHealth,MAR,2014,11,1,,,,,120,132,,10.1007/s10393-013-0878-7,,,13,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,AI7MP,WOS:000337076000014,24121802,,,,2020-12-20,

Humans living close to these wetlands express concerns about future mosquito nuisance situations, and request the necessary distance between human occupation and wetlands to avoid such problems. Wetland managers need to know the distance required, as well as the type of management needed for such buffer or barrier zones. Here we performed an extensive literature survey to collect quantitative information on mosquito flight distance and the relevant environmental conditions. Mosquitoes have an average maximum flight distance of between 50 m and 50 km, depending on the species. Long-distance or migratory flights are strongly related to species ecological preferences and physiology, are survived by few specimens, and do not relate to nuisance situations. Nuisance-related or non-oriented flights are also species-specific and cover much shorter distances-between 25 m and 6 km for the 23 species analyzed. Based on these results, we made regression-based estimations of the percentages of the population that cross certain distances. A 90% reduction in breeding site population density would require minimal distances of 56 m for Anopheles saperoi and 8.6 km for Anopheles sinensis, and much greater distances for Aedes vexans, Culex quinquefasciatus, and Culiseta morsitans. Little useful information was available regarding the environmental conditions under which non-oriented flights took place. Qualitatively, the review showed that flight capacity was influenced by landscape structure, meteorological conditions (temperature, humidity, and illumination), and species physiology (energy available for flight). Overall, our findings suggest that predictions regarding the construction of barrier zones around breeding sites can be made based on mosquito and host density and human nuisance perception, and that barrier zone usefulness strongly depends on the mosquito species involved. Additional quantitative research is needed to better document the non-oriented dispersal patterns of the mosquitoes that populate rewetted and newly constructed wetlands, and the effects of vegetation types in barrier zones on mosquito densities.

The main objective of this work was to study the spatio-temporal host preferences and blood-feeding patterns of malaria vectors in a pastoral area of Senegal where cattle breeding is the main human activity. Methods: Malaria vectors were collected indoors by pyrethrum spray catch in 16 villages belonging to 4 different landscape classes (wooded savanna, shrubby savanna, bare soils and steppe). Blood meals sources were determined using a direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: The blood meal origins of 1886 freshly fed An. gambiae s.l. were determined. Among these blood meals, most were taken on a single host: 40.1% on human and 37.1% on animal. The range in proportions of blood meals taken from human were 25-62.4% in wooded savanna villages, 23.5-61.9% in shrubby savanna villages, 31.3-70% in bare soils villages and 57.7-68.7 in steppe villages. Blood meals taken from bovines were very heterogeneous with two clusters localized in the Northeast and Southwest axis of the study area that corresponds to the distribution of the main water ponds. Patent mixed blood meals taken from human and non-human were significantly higher than those taken from two animals, the highest proportions being observed in September (shrubby savanna, bare soils and steppe villages) or October (wooded savanna villages). Conclusions: These observations suggest that in this pastoral area, differences in feeding patterns of malaria vectors are merely linked to the specific localization of villages and are not influenced by landscape class distribution. In addition, the temporal variations in the anthropophilic rates are influenced by the presence of standing water in the study area.","[Ngom, El Hadji Malick; Ba, Yamar; Diallo, Mawlouth; Dia, Ibrahima] Inst Pasteur, Unite Entomol Med, Dakar, Senegal; [Ngom, El Hadji Malick; Konate, Lassana; Faye, Ousmane] Univ Cheikh Anta Diop Dakar, Lab Ecol Vectorielle & Parasitaire, Dakar, Senegal; [Ndione, Jacques-Andre] Ctr Suivi Ecol, Dakar, Senegal","Dia, I (corresponding author), Inst Pasteur, Unite Entomol Med, 36 Ave Pasteur,BP 220, Dakar, Senegal.",dia@pasteur.sn,,,EUEuropean Union (EU); European CommissionEuropean CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [243964]; Fonds d'Impulsion de la Recherche Scientifique et Technologique (Ministere de la Recherche du Senegal),We are grateful to Sadio Sow for his technical assistance and help during field investigations and the villagers for their cooperation and their active participation in this study.

We examined how adult host-seeking mosquitoes respond to small-scale habitat differences within southern Great Plains cross-timber habitat mosaics in northern Oklahoma consisting of eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginianus L.) woodlands, mixed-deciduous woodlands, and adjacent grasslands. Mosquitoes responded most markedly to an overall grassland-woodland habitat gradient, with species separating by habitat based largely on tree density. Differences in abundance of host-seeking females occurred at fine spatial scales, sometimes varying dramatically over distances as little as 200 m when tree density changed abruptly. Tree type was not as important as tree density, although the West Nile virus vector Culex tarsalis Coquillett showed a greater affinity for areas containing eastern red cedar than for deciduous woodlands. The invasive Aedes albopictus Skuse showed equal affinity for both tree types. Conversion of grassland habitats in the Great Plains to more vegetated environments associated with humans (towns and homesteads) and the invasion of grasslands by eastern red cedar may change the species composition of mosquito, bird, and mammal assemblages and potentially alter arbovirus exposure for humans.","[O'Brien, Valerie A.; Reiskind, Michael H.] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Entomol & Plant Pathol, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [O'Brien, Valerie A.] Tulsa Community Coll, Div Sci & Math, Tulsa, OK 74119 USA","O'Brien, VA (corresponding author), Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Entomol & Plant Pathol, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",valerie.obrien@tulsacc.edu,"Reiskind, Michael Hay/I-5614-2012","Reiskind, Michael/0000-0001-7307-9416",Oklahoma Center for the Advancement of Science and Technology (OCAST) [HR-09-157]; Oklahoma State University Agricultural Experiment Station,"Kelsey Paras and Charles Brown provided assistance with field collection of mosquitoes; Shannon Kispert assisted in mosquito identification; and Monika Ghmire hand-digitized and performed area calculations using aerial photos.

Mosquitoes are the primary vectors of avian malaria and also the definitive hosts in the disease life cycle. Factors pertinent to mosquito ecology are likely to be influential to observed infection patterns; such factors include rainfall, season, temperature, and water quality. Methods: The influence of mosquito abundance and occurrence on the prevalence of Plasmodium spp. in the Ploceidae family (weavers) was examined, taking into account factors with an indirect influence upon mosquito ecology. Mosquitoes and weaver blood samples were simultaneously collected in the Western Cape, South Africa over a two-year period, and patterns of vector abundance and infection prevalence were compared. Dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature and salinity measurements were taken at 20 permanent waterbodies. Rainfall during this period was also quantified using remotely sensed data from up to 6 months prior to sampling months. Results: Sixteen wetlands had weavers infected with avian malaria. More than half of the mosquitoes caught were trapped at one site; when this site was excluded, the number of mosquitoes trapped did not vary significantly between sites. The majority of mosquitoes collected belonged to the predominant vector species group for avian malaria (Culex culex species complex). Seasonal variation occurred in infection and mosquito prevalence, water pH and water temperature, with greater variability observed in summer than in winter. There was a significant correlation of infection prevalence with rainfall two months prior to sampling months. Mosquito prevalence patterns across the landscape also showed a close relationship to patterns of rainfall. Contrary to predictions, a pattern of asynchronous co-variation occurred between mosquito prevalence and infection prevalence. Conclusion: Overall, salinity, rainfall, and mosquito prevalence and season were the most influential vector-related factors on infection prevalence. After comparison with related studies, the tentative conclusion drawn was that patterns of asynchronous variation between malaria prevalence and mosquito abundance were concurrent with those reported in lag response patterns.","[Okanga, Sharon; Cumming, Graeme S.; Hockey, Phillip A.

They are being investigated as tools to manipulate the populations of important vectors of human disease, in particular the mosquitoes that transmit malaria. Before HEGs can be deployed, it is important to study their spatial spread in order to design efficient release strategies. A spatially explicit model is developed to study the spread of a HEG through a landscape whose structure is defined by the distribution of mosquito breeding and feeding sites. The model is motivated by the biology of the major vectors of malaria in Africa. The conditions for spread, fixation and loss of two major types of HEG are explored in different landscapes. In landscapes where mosquito resources are abundant, the conditions for spread are well approximated by a mean-field model. Where a HEG imposes a genetic load, it can cause population extinction, though spatial models more often predict population suppression. In certain types of landscapes where mosquito resources are rare, an introduced HEG may be prevented from moving between local mosquito populations and so a simple release strategy is unlikely to be effective, yet if the HEG succeeds in spreading population extinction is a feasible outcome. Increasing the number of release sites at the expense of releasing fewer mosquitoes per site reduces the probability that a HEG will fail.Synthesis and applications. The model presented asks for the first time how the spatial structure of mosquito populations will influence the effectiveness of a technology that is being rapidly developed for vector control. If homing endonuclease genes (HEGs) are to be used in this way, we have qualified the importance of accounting for landscape characteristics in both the execution and the expectation of their application. The next stage is to use the model to study the spread of HEGs through real landscapes where releases may take place, something that will be facilitated by the results of the present study.

The next stage is to use the model to study the spread of HEGs through real landscapes where releases may take place, something that will be facilitated by the results of the present study.","[North, Ace; Godfray, H.

Large-scale vector control interventions in Cambodia are based on the free distribution of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs), targeting indoor- and late-biting malaria vectors only. The present study evaluated the vector density, early biting activity and malaria transmission of outdoor-biting malaria vectors in two forested regions in Cambodia. Methods: In 2005 two entomological surveys were conducted in 12 villages and their related forest plots in the east and west of Cambodia. Mosquitoes were collected outdoors by human landing collections and subjected to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect Plasmodium sporozoites after morphological identification. Blood samples were collected in the same villages for serological analyses. Collected data were analysed by the classification and regression tree (CART) method and linear regression analysis. Results: A total of 11,826 anophelines were recorded landing in 787 man-night collections. The majority (82.9%) were the known primary and secondary vectors. Most of the variability in vector densities and early biting rates was explained by geographical factors, mainly at village level. Vector densities were similar between forest and village sites. Based on ELISA results, 29% out of 17 Plasmodium-positive bites occurred before sleeping time, and 65% in the forest plots. The entomological inoculation rates of survey 1 were important predictors of the respective seroconversion rates in survey 2, whereas the mosquito densities were not. Discussion: In Cambodia, outdoor malaria transmission in villages and forest plots is important. In this context, deforestation might result in lower densities of the primary vectors, but also in higher densities of secondary vectors invading deforested areas. Moreover, higher accessibility of the forest could result in a higher man-vector contact. Therefore, additional vector control measures should be developed to target outdoor- and early-biting vectors.","[Durnez, Lies; Denis, Leen; Roelants, Patricia; Coosemans, Marc] Inst Trop Med, Dept Biomed Sci, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Mao, Sokny; Sochantha, Tho] Natl Ctr Malaria Control Parasitol & Entomol, Phnom Penh, Cambodia; [Coosemans, Marc] Univ Antwerp, Dept Biomed Sci, B-2020 Antwerp, Belgium","Durnez, L (corresponding author), Inst Trop Med, Dept Biomed Sci, Natl Str 155, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",ldurnez@itg.be,,,"CNMConsejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Institute of Tropical Medicine, Belgium; Belgian Co-operation (Directorate-General for Development Co-operation)","We are grateful to the staff of the National Center for Malaria Control, Parasitology and Entomology in Cambodia who were involved in the planning and implementation of the anophelines collection.

Energy reserves of the resting mosquitoes were analyzed to determine if there was a correlation between mosquito resting habitat and energy accumulation. Six species of plants were selected and 9 collections of resting mosquitoes were aspirated from each plant using a modified John W. Hock backpack aspirator during June and July 2012. Eight mosquito species were collected, with Ae. albopictus representing 74% of the overall collection. The number of Ae. albopictus collected varied significantly with the species of vegetation. When comparing the vegetation and abundance of resting mosquitoes, the highest percentages of Ae. albopictus were collected resting on Ruellia brittoniana (Mexican petunia), Asplenium platyneuron (fern), Gibasis geniculate (Tahitian bridal veil), followed by Plumba goauriculata (plumbago), Setcreasea pallida (purple heart), and Hibiscus tiliaceus (hibiscus). There were significant differences in lipid and glycogen accumulation based on type of vegetation Ae. albopictus was found resting in. Resting mosquitoes' sugar reserves were not influenced by species of vegetation. However, there was an overall correlation between vegetation that serves as a resting habitat and energy reserve accumulation. The results of our study demonstrate the potential to target specific vegetation for control of diurnal resting mosquitoes.","[Samson, Dayana M.; Qualls, Whitney A.; Naranjo, Diana P.; Arheart, Kristopher L.; Beier, John C.] Univ Miami, Miller Sch Med, Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Miami, FL 33136 USA; [Roque, Deborah; Alimi, Temitope] Univ Miami, Abess Ctr Ecosyst Sci & Policy, Coral Gables, FL 33146 USA; [Mueller, Guenter C.] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Fac Med, Kuvin Ctr Study Infect & Trop Dis, IMRIC,Dept Microbiol & Mol Genet, IL-91120 Jerusalem, Israel; [Xue, Rui-De] Anastasia Mosquito Control Dist, St Augustine, FL 32080 USA","Xue, RD (corresponding author), Anastasia Mosquito Control Dist, St Augustine, FL 32080 USA.",,,"Alimi, Temitope/0000-0002-7161-6190","Anastasia Mosquito Control District; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01AI100968, R01GM093345]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R01AI100968, R01AI100968, R01AI100968, R01AI100968, R01AI100968] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM093345, R01GM093345, R01GM093345, R01GM093345, R01GM093345] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",The authors are grateful for the support of the Anastasia Mosquito Control District employees and the residents of the communities.

Since the JEV distribution area has been large and continuously extending toward new Asian and Australasian regions, it is considered an emerging and reemerging pathogen. Despite large effective immunization campaigns, Japanese encephalitis remains a disease of global health concern. JEV zoonotic transmission cycles may be either wild or domestic: the first involves wading birds as wild amplifying hosts; the second involves pigs as the main domestic amplifying hosts. Culex mosquito species, especially Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, are the main competent vectors. Although five JEV genotypes circulate, neither clear-cut genotype-phenotype relationship nor clear variations in genotype fitness to hosts or vectors have been identified. Instead, the molecular epidemiology appears highly dependent on vectors, hosts' biology, and on a set of environmental factors. At global scale, climate, land cover, and land use, otherwise strongly dependent on human activities, affect the abundance of JEV vectors, and of wild and domestic hosts. Chiefly, the increase of rice-cultivated surface, intensively used by wading birds, and of pig production in Asia has provided a high availability of resources to mosquito vectors, enhancing the JEV maintenance, amplification, and transmission. At fine scale, the characteristics (density, size, spatial arrangement) of three landscape elements (paddy fields, pig farms, human habitations) facilitate or impede movement of vectors, then determine how the JEV interacts with hosts and vectors and ultimately the infection risk to humans. If the JEV is introduced in a favorable landscape, either by live infected animals or by vectors, then the virus can emerge and become a major threat for human health. Multidisciplinary research is essential to shed light on the biological mechanisms involved in the emergence, spread, reemergence, and genotypic changes of JEV.","[Le Flohic, Guillaume; Gonzalez, Jean-Paul] CIRMF, UR Ecol & Sante, Franceville, Gabon; [Porphyre, Vincent] CIRAD, Ctr Cooperat Int Rech Agron Dev, Montpellier, France; [Barbazan, Philippe; Gonzalez, Jean-Paul] IRD, Marseille, France; [Gonzalez, Jean-Paul] Mission Cooperat, Minist Affaires Etrangeres & Europeennes, Libreville, Gabon; [Gonzalez, Jean-Paul] Metabiota, Washington, DC USA","Le Flohic, G (corresponding author), CIRMF, UR Ecol & Sante, BP 769, Franceville, Gabon.",leflohg@yahoo.fr,"Porphyre, Vincent/C-4741-2015; Gonzalez, J-P/C-3077-2013","Porphyre, Vincent/0000-0002-5561-2667; Gonzalez, J-P/0000-0003-3063-1770","Research Unit on Emerging diseases [190]; Health Department, Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement, Le Sextant [44]; bd de Dunkerque [CS 90009]; Marseille cedex [13572]","The present work as been funded by the Research Unit 190 on Emerging diseases, Health Department, Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement, Le Sextant, 44, bd de Dunkerque, CS 90009, 13572 Marseille cedex 02.

Our study is, we believe, the first to present a statistical model of dispersal probability against distance from breeding habitat to human settlements for this important disease vector. Methods/Principal Findings: We undertook post-hoc analyses of mosquito catches made in The Gambia to derive statistical dispersal functions for An. gambiae sensu lato collected in 48 villages at varying distances to alluvial larval habitat along the River Gambia. The proportion dispersing declined exponentially with distance, and we estimated that 90% of movements were within 1.7 km. Although a 'heavy-tailed' distribution is considered biologically more plausible due to active dispersal by mosquitoes seeking blood meals, there was no statistical basis for choosing it over a negative exponential distribution. Using a simple random walk model with daily survival and movements previously recorded in Burkina Faso, we were able to reproduce the dispersal probabilities observed in The Gambia. Conclusions/Significance: Our results provide an important quantification of the probability of An. gambiae s.l. dispersal in a rural African setting typical of many parts of the continent. However, dispersal will be landscape specific and in order to generalise to other spatial configurations of habitat and hosts it will be necessary to produce tractable models of mosquito movements for operational use. We show that simple random walk models have potential. Consequently, there is a pressing need for new empirical studies of An. gambiae survival and movements in different settings to drive this development.","[Thomas, Christopher J.; Cross, Donall E.] Aberystwyth Univ, Inst Biol Environm & Rural Sci, Aberystwyth, Dyfed, Wales; [Bogh, Claus] Sumba Fdn, Kuta Poleng, Bali, Indonesia","Thomas, CJ (corresponding author), Aberystwyth Univ, Inst Biol Environm & Rural Sci, Aberystwyth, Dyfed, Wales.",cjt@aber.ac.uk,,,Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council [NE/H022740/1],"This work was funded by Natural Environment Research Council grant NE/H022740/1 (http://www.nerc.ac.uk) and the original study by DANIDA.

A better understanding of the ecology and distribution of malaria vectors is essential to design more effective and sustainable strategies for malaria control and elimination. Here, we analyzed the spatio-temporal risk of the contact between humans and the sympatric An. funestus and both M and S molecular forms of An. gambiae s.s. in an area of Benin with high coverage of vector control measures with an unprecedented level of resolution. Methods: Presence-absence data for the three vectors from 1-year human-landing collections in 19 villages were assessed using binomial mixed-effects models according to vector control measures and environmental covariates derived from field and remote sensing data. After 8-fold cross-validations of the models, predictive maps of the risk of the contact between humans and the sympatric An. funestus and both molecular M and S forms of An. gambiae s.s. were computed. Results: Model validations showed that the An. funestus, An. gambiae M form, and S form models provided an excellent (Area Under Curve>0.9), a good (AUC>0.8), and an acceptable (AUC>0.7) level of prediction, respectively. The distribution area of the probability of contact between human and An. funestus largely overlaps that of An. gambiae M form but this latter showed important seasonal variation. An. gambiae S form also showed seasonal variation but with different ecological preferences. Landscape data were useful to discriminate between the species' distributions. Conclusions: These results showed that available remote sensing data could help in predicting the human-vector contact for several species of malaria vectors at a village level scale. The predictive maps showed seasonal and spatial variations in the risk of human-vector contact for all three vectors. Such maps could help Malaria Control Programmes to implement more effective vector control strategy by taking into account to the dynamics of malaria vector species.","[Moiroux, Nicolas; Chandre, Fabrice; Corbel, Vincent] IRD, MIVEGEC IRD CNRS 5290 UM1 UM2 224, F-34394 Montpellier, France; [Djenontin, Armel] IRD, MIVEGEC IRD CNRS 5290 UM1 UM2 224, Cotonou, Benin; [Bio-Bangana, Abdul S.; Djenontin, Armel] Minist Sante, CREC, Cotonou, Benin; [Corbel, Vincent] Kasetsart Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Entomol, Bangkok 10900, Thailand; [Guis, Helene] CIRAD, UMR CMAEE, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Guis, Helene] INRA, UMR CMAEE 1309, F-34398 Montpellier, France","Moiroux, N (corresponding author), IRD, MIVEGEC IRD CNRS 5290 UM1 UM2 224, BP64501, F-34394 Montpellier, France.",nicolas.moiroux@ird.fr,"Corbel, VIncent/G-9576-2016; Chandre, Fabrice/Q-3429-2019","Chandre, Fabrice/0000-0002-1994-9705; Moiroux, Nicolas/0000-0001-6755-6167",French ministry of foreign affairs through the SCAC programme; IRD; EUEuropean Union (EU) [FP7-261504 EDENext],"We thank populations of the villages for their kind support and collaboration.

Evaluation of local transmission epidemiology to characterize malaria risk is essential for planning malaria control and elimination programmes. The use of geographical information systems (GIS) techniques has been a major asset to this approach. To assess time and space distribution of malaria disease in Bandiagara, Mali, within a transmission season, data were used from an ongoing malaria incidence study that enrolled 300 participants aged under six years old. Methods: Children's households were georeferenced using a handheld global position system. Clinical malaria was defined as a positive blood slide for Plasmodium falciparum asexual stages associated with at least one of the following signs: headache, body aches, fever, chills and weakness. Daily rainfall was measured at the local weather station. Landscape features of Bandiagara were obtained from satellite images and field survey. QGIS (TM) software was used to map malaria cases, affected and non-affected children, and the number of malaria episodes per child in each block of Bandiagara. Clusters of high or low risk were identified under SaTScan (R) software according to a Bernoulli model. Results: From June 2009 to May 2010, 296 clinical malaria cases were recorded. Though clearly temporally related to the rains, Plasmodium falciparum occurrence persisted late in the dry season. Two hot spots of malaria transmission also found, notably along the Yame River, characterized by higher than expected numbers of malaria cases, and high numbers of clinical episodes per child. Conversely, the north-eastern sector of the town had fewer cases despite its proximity to a large body of standing water which was mosquito habitat. Conclusion: These results confirm the existence of a marked spatial heterogeneity of malaria transmission in Bandiagara, providing support for implementation of targeted interventions.","[Coulibaly, Drissa; Tolo, Youssouf; Kone, Abdoulaye K.; Traore, Karim; Guindo, Ando; Diarra, Issa; Niangaly, Amadou; Daou, Modibo; Dembele, Ahmadou; Sissoko, Mody; Kouriba, Bourema; Thera, Mahamadou A.; Doumbo, Ogobara K.] Univ Sci Tech & Technol Bamako, Fac Med & Dent, Dept Epidemiol Parasit Dis, Bamako, Mali; [Travassos, Mark; Laurens, Matthew; Plowe, Christopher V.] Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Ctr Vaccine Dev, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Rebaudet, Stanislas; Gaudart, Jean; Piarroux, Renaud] Aix Marseille Univ, Marseille, France; [Dessay, Nadine] Inst Rech Dev, Montpellier, France","Coulibaly, D (corresponding author), Univ Sci Tech & Technol Bamako, Fac Med & Dent, Dept Epidemiol Parasit Dis, BP 1805,Point G, Bamako, Mali.",coulibalyd@icermali.org,"Laurens, Matthew/E-7293-2013; gaudart, jean/D-9071-2013; Dessay, Nadine/Y-1791-2019; Dessay, Nadine/J-9856-2016","Laurens, Matthew/0000-0003-3874-581X; gaudart, jean/0000-0001-9006-5729; Dessay, Nadine/0000-0003-0526-3531; Dessay, Nadine/0000-0003-0526-3531; Thera, Mahamadou A/0000-0002-2679-035X; piarroux, renaud/0000-0002-4151-4134","National Institute of Allergy and Infectious DiseasesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [5U01AI065683]; Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC) [D43TW001589]; FOGARTY INTERNATIONAL CENTERUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC) [D43TW001589, D43TW001589, D43TW001589, D43TW001589, D43TW001589, D43TW001589, D43TW001589, D43TW001589, D43TW001589, D43TW001589, D43TW001589, D43TW001589, D43TW001589, D43TW001589, D43TW001589, D43TW001589, D43TW001589, D43TW001589, D43TW001589] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [U01AI065683, U01AI065683, U01AI065683, U01AI065683, U01AI065683] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","The Malaria Incidence Study was supported by cooperative agreement 5U01AI065683 from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; The GIS study was supported by the AMMA consortium and the grant D43TW001589 from the Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health.",,42,24,26,0,44,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1475-2875,,,MALARIA J,Malar.

For mosquitoes, existing spatial models use only habitat elements (hydrologic and floristic) to predict the distribution of disease vectors within the landscape, ignoring the potential importance of the distribution of hosts. We tested the hypothesis that the distribution of hosts would better explain the spatial distribution of mosquitoes than habitat variables using Information Theory and Poisson Regression. We analyzed the abundance of ectotherm-biting mosquitoes and their hosts from 37 points over a 28-km(2) area in Tuskegee National Forest, Alabama, USA. We compared models built using information regarding habitat, hosts, or both for their ability to explain the abundance of Culex peccator and Culex territans, two mosquito species that specialize on reptiles and amphibians. Models built using both host and habitat information were the best models for both species, suggesting that information regarding the distribution of mosquito hosts greatly improves models of mosquito distributions. Moreover, when differences in habitat makeup among stations were accounted for, mosquitoes were found to be significantly more abundant at locations with greater host abundance. Since most mosquitoes feed on only a limited range of hosts and successful blood feeding is one of the most crucial bottlenecks in the life cycle of mosquitoes, it follows that mosquitoes would aggregate in areas of greatest host density. Habitat influences the availability of suitable larval development sites, and to some extent, distribution of hosts. Our analysis, however, shows that within the landscape the distribution of host animals is a crucial factor in determining the spatial distribution of vectors. This has clear and important implications for determining which areas are at a greater risk for zoonotic arboviruses and is a potentially transformative paradigm for understanding the factors that influence the spatial distribution of disease vectors.","[Burkett-Cadena, Nathan D.; Eubanks, Micky D.] Auburn Univ, Dept Entomol & Plant Pathol, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [McClure, Christopher J.

These include several instances of simple mutational adaptations, often to hosts closely related to the natural reservoirs. However, based on theoretical grounds, arthropod-borne viruses, or arboviruses, may face several challenges for adaptation to new hosts. Here, we review recent findings regarding adaptive evolution of arboviruses and its impact on disease emergence. We focus on the zoonotic alphaviruses Venezuelan equine encephalitis and chikungunya viruses, which have undergone adaptive evolution that mediated recent outbreaks of disease, as well as the flaviviruses dengue and West Nile viruses, which have emerged via less dramatic adaptive mechanisms.","[Coffey, Lark L.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Lab Med, Blood Syst Res Inst, San Francisco, CA 94118 USA; [Forrester, Naomi; Tsetsarkin, Konstantin; Vasilakis, Nikos; Weaver, Scott C.] Univ Texas Med Branch, Inst Human Infect & Immun, Ctr Biodef & Emerging Infect Dis, Galveston, TX 77555 USA; [Forrester, Naomi; Tsetsarkin, Konstantin; Vasilakis, Nikos; Weaver, Scott C.] Univ Texas Med Branch, Dept Pathol, Galveston, TX 77555 USA","Weaver, SC (corresponding author), Univ Texas Med Branch, Inst Human Infect & Immun, Ctr Biodef & Emerging Infect Dis, Galveston, TX 77555 USA.",sweaver@utmb.edu,"Weaver, Scott C/D-6490-2011; Vasilakis, Nikos/ABE-7318-2020","Weaver, Scott C/0000-0001-8016-8556; ","NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01-AI071192, R01-AI069145, R01-AI48807]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R01AI069145, R01AI071192, R01AI048807, R01AI048807, R01AI069145, R01AI048807, R01AI048807, R01AI071192, R01AI071192, R01AI048807, R01AI069145, R01AI048807, R01AI069145, R01AI071192, R01AI071192, R01AI071192] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","The research described was supported by NIH grants R01-AI071192, R01-AI069145 and R01-AI48807.

West Nile virus (WNV), the world's most widespread arbovirus, invaded the United States in 1999 and rapidly spread across the county. Although the ecology of vectors and hosts are key determinants of WNV prevalence across landscapes, the factors shaping local vector and host populations remain unclear. Here, we used spatially-explicit models to evaluate how three land-use types (orchards, vegetable/forage crops, natural) and two climatic variables (temperature, precipitation) influence the prevalence of WNV infections and vector/host distributions at landscape and local spatial scales. Across landscapes, we show that orchard habitats were associated with greater prevalence of WNV infections in reservoirs (birds) and incidental hosts (horses), while increased precipitation was associated with fewer infections. At local scales, orchard habitats increased the prevalence of WNV infections in vectors (mosquitoes) and the abundance of mosquitoes and two key reservoir species, the American robin and the house sparrow. Thus, orchard habitats benefitted WNV vectors and reservoir hosts locally, creating focal points for the transmission of WNV at landscape scales in the presence of suitable climatic conditions.","[Crowder, David W.; Martin, Emily; Peterson, Wade; Owen, Jeb P.] Washington State Univ, Dept Entomol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Dykstra, Elizabeth A.; Brauner, Jo Marie; Duffy, Anne; Reed, Caitlin] Washington State Dept Hlth, Olympia, WA USA; [Carriere, Yves] Univ Arizona, Dept Entomol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Dutilleul, Pierre] McGill Univ, Dept Plant Sci, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ, Canada","Crowder, DW (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Dept Entomol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",dcrowder@wsu.edu,,"Owen, Jeb/0000-0002-2042-0526; Scott, Emily/0000-0001-9295-9320",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agriculture and Food Research Initiative [2011-67012-30718]; USDA Risk Avoidance and Mitigation Program [2006-0207436],"This study was supported by United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Project 2011-67012-30718 and USDA Risk Avoidance and Mitigation Program Project 2006-0207436.

To determine the influence of hematophagous insects on endangered vertebrates requires specially designed programs that minimize disturbance to the hosts and address problems associated with their small populations. We developed and evaluated a surveillance program for black flies potentially affecting a population of whooping cranes (Grus americana) introduced to central Wisconsin, U.S.A. In one of the few studies to survey host-seeking female black flies and their immature stages concurrently, we processed nearly 346,000 specimens and documented 26 species, of which only two, Simulium annulus and Simulium johannseni, were attracted to nesting whooping cranes. Attempts to assess black fly populations with artificial nests and real crane eggs were unsuccessful. Carbon-dioxide traps performed well in describing black fly taxa on the landscape. However, the number of black flies at whooping crane nests was consistently higher than the number captured in carbon-dioxide traps. The carbon-dioxide traps poorly described the presence/absence, population fluctuations, and periodicity of black flies at whooping crane nests. The weak performance of the carbon-dioxide traps might have resulted from microhabitat differences between trap locations and nests or from Simulium annulus and Simulium johannseni using sensory cues in addition to carbon dioxide to find hosts. Choice of trapping techniques, therefore, depends on the information required for the particular study objectives.","[King, Richard S.] Necedah Natl Wildlife Refuge, Necedah, WI 54646 USA; [Adler, Peter H.] Clemson Univ, Entomol Program, Clemson, SC 29634 USA","King, RS (corresponding author), Necedah Natl Wildlife Refuge, N11385 Headquarters Rd, Necedah, WI 54646 USA.",richard_king@fws.gov,,,U.S. Fish and Wildlife ServiceUS Fish & Wildlife Service; National Fish and Wildlife Foundation; Natural Resource Foundation of Wisconsin; NIFA/USDAUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [SC-1700276],"We thank the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, and the Natural Resource Foundation of Wisconsin for funding this research.

There are numerous important vector species, with variable geographic ranges and ecologies, considered crucial to the transmission of WNV in the coterminous United States. To date there has been a lack of a systematic investigation in the United States, at a regional scale, of the wide variety of landscape, land use, and demographic influences on WNV incidence. In this study, we use published vector species distribution maps, as well as prominent landscape features, to define six distinct regions of the coterminous United States. We relate data on demographic, landscape, and land use conditions to the incidence of human WNV by region recorded at county level in the coterminous United States from 2002-2009. The observed relationships varied by region with the Great Plains, Northwest, and Southwest regions showing high WNV incidence associated with rural irrigated landscapes, indicating the importance of Culex tarsalis as the primary vector. In the Southeast, the percent of the population in poverty was positively associated with high WNV incidence, potentially indicating the quality of housing in relation to the vector Culex quinquefasciatus, a mosquito that often feeds indoors. The Northeast region human WNV incidence was positively associated with agricultural landscapes, potentially implying the importance of Culex restuans in a region generally thought of as being dominated by Culex pipiens transmission. There was strong spatial autocorrelation in most of the regions, but with a spatial autologistic term accounted for in binary logistic regression models, there were significant landscape, land use, and demographic covariates for each region.","[DeGroote, John P.] Univ No Iowa, GeoTREE Ctr, ITTC 240, Dept Geog, Cedar Falls, IA 50614 USA","DeGroote, JP (corresponding author), Univ No Iowa, GeoTREE Ctr, ITTC 240, Dept Geog, Cedar Falls, IA 50614 USA.",John.degroote@uni.edu,,,National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency University Research Initiative program [HM1582-10-1-0010],This research was supported through funding from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency University Research Initiative program (award no.

With increasing urbanization and the resulting emergence of zoonotic diseases, it is critical to understand the relationships among birds, vectors, zoonotic pathogens, and the urban landscape. Here, we use wild birds as sentinels across a gradient of urbanization to understand the relative risk of diseases caused by three types of zoonotic pathogens: Salmonella pathogens, mosquito-borne West Nile virus (WNV) and tick-borne pathogens, including the agents of Lyme disease and human anaplasmosis. Wild birds were captured using mist nets at five sites throughout greater Chicago, Illinois, and blood, faecal and ectoparasite samples were collected for diagnostic testing. A total of 289 birds were captured across all sites. A total of 2.8% of birds harboured Ixodes scapularis the blacklegged tick of which 54.5% were infected with the agent of Lyme disease, and none were infected with the agent of human anaplasmosis. All infested birds were from a single site that was relatively less urban. A single bird, captured at the only field site in which supplemental bird feeding was practised within the mist netting zone, was infected with Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica. While no birds harboured WNV in their blood, 3.5% of birds were seropositive, and birds from more urban sites had higher exposure to the virus than those from less urban sites. Our results demonstrate the presence of multiple bird-borne zoonotic pathogens across a gradient of urbanization and provide an assessment of potential public health risks to the high-density human populations within the area.","[Hamer, S.

An almost universal feature of TEs in eukaryotic genomes is their inability to transpose by themselves, mainly as the result of sequence degeneration (by either mutations or deletions). Most of the elements are thus either inactive or non-autonomous. Considering that the bulk of some eukaryotic genomes derive from TEs, they have been conceived as TE graveyards. It has been shown that once an element has been inactivated, it progressively accumulates mutations and deletions at neutral rates until completely losing its identity or being lost from the host genome; however, it has also been shown that these neutral sequences might serve as raw material for domestication by host genomes. Results: We have analyzed the sequence structural variations, nucleotide divergence, and pattern of insertions and deletions of several superfamilies of TEs belonging to both class I (long terminal repeats [LTRs] and non-LTRs [NLTRs]) and II in the genome of Anopheles gambiae, aiming at describing the landscape of deterioration of these elements in this particular genome. Our results describe a great diversity in patterns of deterioration, indicating lineage-specific differences including the presence of Solo-LTRs in the LTR lineage, 5'-deleted NLTRs, and several non-autonomous and MITEs in the class II families. Interestingly, we found fragments of NLTRs corresponding to the RT domain, which preserves high identity among them, suggesting a possible remaining genomic role for these domains. Conclusions: We show here that the TEs in the An. gambiae genome deteriorate in different ways according to the class to which they belong. This diversity certainly has implications not only at the host genomic level but also at the amplification dynamic and evolution of the TE families themselves.","[Fernandez-Medina, Rita D.; Struchiner, Claudio J.] Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Escola Nacl Saude Publ Sergio Arouca, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Ribeiro, Jose M.

Environmentally, four main concerns are mapped out: first, there are potential water safety risks, such as water resource abuse, water pollution and groundwater recharge deficiency; second, unreasonable construction will lead to land-use overexpansion, land pollution and service expectancy reduction; third, microalgae production may exert a detrimental effect on the local ecosystem, causing algal blooms and biological invasion; finally, microalgae might emit unexpected greenhouse gases [nitrogen oxides (NO x ), methane (CH4)] and ammonia (NH3). From an economic risk standpoint, microalgae production requires an overwhelming investment due to the expensive start-up and operation. Socially, contaminant discharge will threaten the health of local animals and people. Moreover, the safety effects of genetically modified algae may not be immediately apparent or known. In addition, over time, microalgae may become a medium for mosquitoes to spread disease. From a cultural point of view, it requires time for people in developing countries to adapt algal oil to their daily life as an alternative to conventional fossil fuels. Furthermore, personnel changes in the workforce may harm existing cultural structures, and landscape aesthetics may be affected by system construction. Taking the above challenges into consideration, efficient government policies, proactive company behaviours and positive public participation will play an important role in minimising or even eliminating these potential risks.","[Zhu, Liandong] Univ Vaasa, Fac Technol, FI-65101 Vaasa, Finland; [Ketola, Tarja] Univ Turku, Sch Econ, FI-20500 Turku, Finland","Zhu, LD (corresponding author), Univ Vaasa, Fac Technol, POB 700, FI-65101 Vaasa, Finland.",liandong.zhu@uwasa.fi,"Zhu, Liandong/AAH-2427-2020",,Fortum Foundation in Finland,This work was supported by the Fortum Foundation in Finland.

Mosquito-borne flaviviruses have been isolated and characterized in Northern Italy: West Nile virus and Usutu virus were detected in mosquitoes and in different host species and recent studies provided evidence about the circulation of insect Flavivirus strains. Methods: In order to clarify the diffusion and the distribution of the mosquito-transmitted flaviviruses in Italy, we analyzed Culex and Ochlerotatus mosquitoes collected in 2009 and 2010 in an area divided evenly between hills and plains and where the landscape is dominated by mixed agricultural patches, rice fields, deciduous tree forests, and urban environments. Each mosquito pool was tested for the presence of Flavivirus strains and we characterized positive samples by genetic sequencing. Results: Positive mosquito pools revealed low infection prevalence, but suggested a continuous circulation of both Usutu virus and insect Flavivirus. Interestingly, phylogenetic analyses based on NS5 gene partial sequences showed a closer relationship among new Usutu virus strains from Piedmont and the reference sequences from the Eastern Europe, with respect to Italian samples characterized so far. Moreover, NS5 gene phylogeny suggested that mosquito flaviviruses found in Italy could belong to different lineages. Conclusions: Our results contribute to a wider point of view on the heterogeneity of viruses infecting mosquitoes suggesting a taxonomical revision of the Mosquito-borne Flavivirus group.","[Cerutti, Francesco; Giacobini, Mario; Rambozzi, Luisa; Rossi, Luca; Bertolotti, Luigi] Univ Turin, Dept Anim Prod Epidemiol & Ecol, Turin, Italy; [Cerutti, Francesco; Giacobini, Mario] Univ Turin, Ctr Mol Biotechnol, Turin, Italy; [Mosca, Andrea; Grasso, Ivan] Reg Govt Owned Corp Reg Piemonte, IPLA, Turin, Italy","Cerutti, F (corresponding author), Univ Turin, Dept Anim Prod Epidemiol & Ecol, Turin, Italy.",luigi.bertolotti@unito.it,"Bertolotti, Luigi/F-9236-2013; Cerutti, Francesco/J-5920-2016","Bertolotti, Luigi/0000-0001-7931-4528; Cerutti, Francesco/0000-0003-0480-8296; MOSCA, Andrea/0000-0003-2180-0405; Giacobini, Mario/0000-0002-7647-5649",IPLA field technicians; Ricerca Sanitaria Finalizzata - Regione PiemonteRegione Piemonte,"The authors acknowledge Prof. Tony L.

This study analyzed the spatial patterns of human WNV cases in three areas in South Dakota during 2003-2007 and investigated the influences of land cover, hydrology, soils, irrigation, and elevation by using case-control models. Land cover, hydrology, soils, and elevation all influenced WNV risk, although the main drivers were different in each study area. Risk for WNV was generally higher in areas with rural land cover than in developed areas, and higher close to wetlands or soils with a high ponding frequency. In western South Dakota, WNV risk also decreased with increasing elevation and was higher in forested areas. Our results showed that the spatial patterns of human WNV risk were associated with landscape-level features that likely reflect variability in mosquito ecology, avian host communities, and human activity.","[Chuang, Ting-Wu; Wimberly, Michael C.] S Dakota State Univ, Geog Informat Sci Ctr Excellence, Brookings, SD 57007 USA; [Hockett, Christine W.; Kightlinger, Lon] S Dakota Dept Hlth, Pierre, SD USA","Chuang, TW (corresponding author), S Dakota State Univ, Geog Informat Sci Ctr Excellence, 1021 Medary Ave,Wecota Hall, Brookings, SD 57007 USA.",ting-wu.chuang@sdstate.edu; Christine.Hockett@state.sd.us; Lon.Kightlinger@state.sd.us; michael.wimberly@sdstate.edu,,"Wimberly, Michael/0000-0003-1549-3891","National Institute of Allergy and Infectious DiseasesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R01-AI079411]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R01AI079411, R01AI079411, R01AI079411, R01AI079411, R01AI079411, R01AI079411, R01AI079411, R01AI079411, R01AI079411, R01AI079411, R01AI079411] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",This study was supported by grant R01-AI079411 from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.,,41,24,24,1,29,AMER SOC TROP MED & HYGIENE,MCLEAN,"8000 WESTPARK DR, STE 130, MCLEAN, VA 22101 USA",0002-9637,,,AM J TROP MED HYG,Am.

We examine interactions of these aliens with their new environments in the context of rapid global change linked to human activity. We consider effects of such interactions on establishment and spread of the alien species and effects on indigenous biota and ecosystems. Major elements of global change that affect alien-environment interactions include landscape modifications by humans (e.g., cultivation, habitat loss and fragmentation) and increases in atmospheric CO2 and other gases resulting in climate change and other effects (e.g., changes in food quality for herbivores that affect higher trophic levels as well). Alien arthropod predators can alter landscapes for their benefit, to the detriment of indigenous species.

Currently, more than half of the global population is concentrated in urban environments, which are highly heterogeneous in the extent, degree, and distribution of environmental modifications. Because the prevalence of vector-borne pathogens is so closely coupled to the ecologies of vector and host species, this heterogeneity has the potential to significantly alter the dynamical systems through which pathogens propagate, and also thereby affect the epidemiological patterns of disease at multiple spatial scales. One such pattern is the speed of spread. Whereas standard models hold that pathogens spread as waves with constant or increasing speed, we hypothesized that heterogeneity in urban environments would cause decelerating travelling waves in incipient epidemics. To test this hypothesis, we analysed data on the spread of West Nile virus (WNV) in New York City (NYC), the 1999 epicentre of the North American pandemic, during annual epizootics from 2000-2008. These data show evidence of deceleration in all years studied, consistent with our hypothesis. To further explain these patterns, we developed a spatial model for vector-borne disease transmission in a heterogeneous environment. An emergent property of this model is that deceleration occurs only in the vicinity of a critical point. Geostatistical analysis suggests that NYC may be on the edge of this criticality. Together, these analyses provide the first evidence for the endogenous generation of decelerating travelling waves in an emerging infectious disease. Since the reported deceleration results from the heterogeneity of the environment through which the pathogen percolates, our findings suggest that targeting control at key sites could efficiently prevent pathogen spread to remote susceptible areas or even halt epidemics.","[Magori, Krisztian; Bowden, Sarah; Drake, John M.] Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Bajwa, Waheed I.] New York City Dept Hlth & Mental Hyg, Off Vector Surveillance & Control, New York, NY USA","Magori, K (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",kmagori@uga.edu,"Drake, John/D-6622-2012; Bajwa, Waheed/AAH-9668-2019; Magori, Krisztian/H-9516-2019","Drake, John/0000-0003-4646-1235; Magori, Krisztian/0000-0002-2288-835X; Bowden, Sarah/0000-0003-0722-793X",NSF-NIHNational Science Foundation (NSF)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [EF-0723601],"This study was supported by research grant EF-0723601 from the joint NSF-NIH Ecology of Infectious Diseases program.

We compared abundance of vector species between urban and suburban neighborhoods of Henrico County, VA, in relation to the following factors: temperature, precipitation, canopy cover, building footprint, and proximity to drainage infrastructure. Mosquitoes were collected throughout the 2005, 2006, and 2007 seasons and tested for West Nile virus (WNV) in pools of 10-50. Test results of mosquito pools were compared to average site abundance from 37 sites in Henrico County, VA; abundance was then examined in relation to ecological variables. Urban infrastructure was positively correlated with the abundance of Culex pipiens L./Cx. restuans, and our findings implicate combined sewer overflow systems as large contributors to Culex vector populations. No measure of urbanization examined in our study was correlated with Aedes albopictus abundance. Our study showed that certain landscape variables identified using Geographic Information Systems are valuable for predicting primary WNV vector abundance in Virginia, and that temperature along with low precipitation are strong predictors of population growth.

With regard to health, the approach consists of systems analysis using a set of powerful tools aimed at the reduction of community vulnerability through improved public policies. The north-oriental malaria focus, one of five such foci in Venezuela, situated in the north-eastern part of the Estado Sucre state, unites several social and environmental features and functions as an epidemiological corridor, i.e. an endemic zone characterised by permanent interaction between the mosquito vector and the human host allowing a continuous persistence of the malaria lifecycle. A GIS was developed based on official cartography with thematic overlays depicting malaria distribution, socio-economic conditions, basic environmental information and specific features associated with the natural wetlands present in the area. Generally, malaria foci are continuously active but when the malaria situation was modelled in the north-oriental focus, a differential, spatio-temporal distribution pattern situation was found, i.e. a situation oscillating between very active and dormant transmission. This pattern was displayed by spatial and statistical analysis based on the model generated in this study and the results were confirmed by municipal and county malaria records. Control of malaria, keeping the incidence at a permanently low level within the regional population, should be possible if these results are taken into account when designing and implementing epidemiological surveillance policies.","[Delgado-Petrocelli, Laura; Ramos, Santiago] Cent Univ Caracas, Ecol Informat Syst & Environm Modeling Lab SIMEA, Inst Trop Zool, Caracas, Venezuela; [Camardiel, A.] Cent Univ Caracas, Postgrad Area Stat & Actuarial Sci, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Caracas, Venezuela; [Aguilar, V.

Cases have been reported from at least 32 countries in Africa (mainly west), Australia, Southeast Asia, China, Central and South America, and the Western Pacific. Large lesions often result in scarring, contractual deformities, amputations, and disabilities, and in Africa, most cases of the disease occur in children between the ages of 4-15 years. This environmental mycobacterium, Mycobacterium ulcerans, is found in communities associated with rivers, swamps, wetlands, and human-linked changes in the aquatic environment, particularly those created as a result of environmental disturbance such as deforestation, dam construction, and agriculture. Buruli ulcer disease is often referred to as the mysterious disease because the mode of transmission remains unclear, although several hypotheses have been proposed. The above review reveals that various routes of transmission may occur, varying amongst epidemiological setting and geographic region, and that there may be some role for living agents as reservoirs and as vectors of M. ulcerans, in particular aquatic insects, adult mosquitoes or other biting arthropods. We discuss traditional and non-traditional methods for indicting the roles of living agents as biologically significant reservoirs and/or vectors of pathogens, and suggest an intellectual framework for establishing criteria for transmission. The application of these criteria to the transmission of M. ulcerans presents a significant challenge.","[Merritt, Richard W.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Entomol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Walker, Edward D.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Entomol & Microbiol & Mol Genet, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Small, Pamela L.

Based on its many known competent vectors, its potential for transmission via aerosolization, and its progressive spread from East Africa to neighbouring regions, RVF is considered a high-priority, emerging health threat for humans, livestock and wildlife in all parts of the world. Introduction of West Nile virus to North America has shown the potential for exotic viral pathogens to become embedded in local ecological systems. While RVF is known to infect and amplify within domestic livestock, such as taurine cattle, sheep and goats, if RVF virus is accidentally or intentionally introduced into North America, an important unknown factor will be the role of local wildlife in the maintenance or propagation of virus transmission. We examined the potential impact of RVF transmission via white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in a typical north-eastern United States urban-suburban landscape, where livestock are rare but where these potentially susceptible, ungulate wildlife are highly abundant. Model results, based on overlap of mosquito, human and projected deer densities, indicate that a significant proportion (497/1186 km(2), i.e. 42%) of the urban and peri-urban landscape could be affected by RVF transmission during the late summer months. Deer population losses, either by intervention for herd reduction or by RVF-related mortality, would substantially reduce these likely transmission zones to 53.1 km(2), i.e. by 89%.","[Kakani, Sravan; LaBeaud, A.

Frequent epidemic outbreaks are believed to be driven by a complex interplay of immunological interactions between its four co-circulating serotypes and large fluctuations in mosquito densities. Viral lineage replacement events, caused for example by different levels of cross-protection or differences in viral fitness, have also been linked to a temporary change in dengue epidemiology. A major replacement event was recently described for South-East Asia where the Asian-1 genotype of dengue serotype 2 replaced the resident Asian/American type. Although this was proposed to be due to increased viral fitness in terms of enhanced human-to-mosquito transmission, no major change in dengue epidemiology could be observed. Methods/Results: Here we investigate the invasion dynamics of a novel, advantageous dengue genotype within a model system and determine the factors influencing the success and rate of fixation as well as their epidemiological consequences. We find that while viral fitness overall correlates with invasion success and competitive exclusion of the resident genotype, the epidemiological landscape plays a more significant role for successful emergence. Novel genotypes can thus face high risks of stochastic extinction despite their fitness advantage if they get introduced during episodes of high dengue prevalence, especially with respect to that particular serotype. Conclusion: The rarity of markers for positive selection has often been explained by strong purifying selection whereby the constraints imposed by dengue's two-host cycle are expected to result in a high rate of deleterious mutations. Our results demonstrate that even highly beneficial mutants are under severe threat of extinction, which would suggest that apart from purifying selection, stochastic effects and genetic drift beyond seasonal bottlenecks are equally important in shaping dengue's viral ecology and evolution.","[Lourenco, Jose; Recker, Mario] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England","Lourenco, J (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PS, England.",mario.recker@zoo.ox.ac.uk,,"Recker, Mario/0000-0001-9489-1315; Lourenco, Jose/0000-0002-9318-2581","Fundacao para a Ciencia e TecnologiaPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology; Siemens Portugal under Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciencia, Oeiras, Portugal; Royal Society URFRoyal Society of London","JL is supported by the Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia and Siemens Portugal under a Ph.D. Program in Computational Biology of the Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciencia, Oeiras, Portugal.

In these situations little is known about the secondary vectors which are responsible for maintaining transmission. Basic information on the identification of the species in these rural communities is required so that transmission parameters, such as ecology, behaviour and vectorial status can be assigned to the appropriate species. Methods: In two rural villages - Khe Ngang and Hang Chuon - in Truong Xuan Commune, Quang Binh Province, north central Vietnam, a series of longitudinal entomological surveys were conducted during the wet and dry seasons from 2003 - 2007. In these surveys anopheline mosquitoes were collected in human landing catches, paired human and animal bait collections, and from larval surveys. Specimens belonging to species complexes were identified by PCR and sequence analysis, incrimination of vectors was by detection of circumsporozoite protein using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: Over 80% of the anopheline fauna was made up of Anopheles sinensis, Anopheles aconitus, Anopheles harrisoni, Anopheles maculatus, Anopheles sawadwongporni, and Anopheles philippinensis. PCR and sequence analysis resolved identification issues in the Funestus Group, Maculatus Group, Hyrcanus Group and Dirus Complex. Most species were zoophilic and while all species could be collected biting humans significantly higher densities were attracted to cattle and buffalo. Anopheles dirus was the most anthropophilic species but was uncommon making up only 1.24% of all anophelines collected. Anopheles sinensis, An. aconitus, An. harrisoni, An. maculatus, An. sawadwongporni, Anopheles peditaeniatus and An. philippinensis were all found positive for circumsporozoite protein. Heterogeneity in oviposition site preference between species enabled vector densities to be high in both the wet and dry seasons allowing for year round transmission. Conclusions: In rural communities in north central Vietnam, malaria transmission was maintained by a number of anopheline species which though collected feeding on humans were predominantly zoophilic, this behaviour allows for low level but persistent malaria transmission. The important animal baits - cattle and buffalo - were kept in the village and barrier spraying around these animals may be more effective at reducing vector densities and longevity than the currently used indoor residual spraying.","[Cooper, Robert D.] Australian Army Malaria Inst, Enoggera, Qld 4051, Australia; [Cuong Do Manh; Van Nguyen Thi Van; Tao Le Quang; Chau Tran Lein; Thanh Nguyen Xuan; Anh Le Ngoc] Mil Inst Hyg & Epidemiol, Dept Entomol, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Beebe, Nigel W.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Beebe, Nigel W.] CSIRO Entomol, Long Pocket Labs, Indooroopilly, Qld 4068, Australia; [Dung Van Nguyen] Mil Prevent Med Ctr, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","Cooper, RD (corresponding author), Australian Army Malaria Inst, Enoggera, Qld 4051, Australia.",bob.cooper@defence.gov.au,"Beebe, Nigel W/C-5610-2008","Beebe, Nigel W/0000-0003-2877-0691","International Policy Division, Australian Defence Organisation","This study received financial support from the International Policy Division, Australian Defence Organisation.

Because immunity to malaria is nonsterilizing and builds up slowly through repeated infections, commonly the parasite invades a host that is immunologically and physiologically different from its previous host. During the course of infection, the parasite must also keep pace with changes in host immune responses and red-blood-cell physiology. Here, we describe the selection landscape of the most virulent of the human malaria parasites, Plasmodium falciparum, and the adaptive mechanisms it uses to navigate through that landscape. Taking a cost-benefit view of parasite fitness, we consider the evolutionary outcomes of the most important forces of selection operating on the parasite, namely immunity, host death, drugs, mosquito availability, and coinfection. Given the huge potential for malaria parasite evolution in the context of the recently renewed effort to eradicate malaria, a deeper understanding of P. falciparum adaptation is essential.","[Mackinnon, M.

Prevalence values were tested for correlation with a large number of environmental variables, as modeled from weather station data and measured by satellite-borne sensors. Predictions were made based on the expected effects of climatic and landscape variables on sustained populations of arthropod vectors required for transmission of microfilariae. In general, findings were consistent with predictions in both cormorants and penguins; prevalence correlated positively with temperature, precipitation, and vegetation density, and negatively with measures of environmental variability. Resulting correlates were used to derive predictive distributions of prevalence values in cormorants throughout the archipelago. Evidence is presented implicating the mosquito Aedes taeniorhynchus as a likely vector. Knowledge of environmental variables that predict risk of disease transmission by arthropod vectors may be useful in control measures should novel pathogens be introduced to the ecosystem.","[Siers, Shane; Merkel, Jane; Bataille, Arnaud; Vargas, F.

(Diptera: Culicidae) has a short dispersal capacity, and that displacement can be influenced by the availability of oviposition sites in the surroundings of emergence or release sites. In the present article, we observed the influence of spatial heterogeneity of large containers and human hosts on the cumulative flight direction of Ae. aegypti females during the first gonotrophic cycle, testing the hypothesis that they aggregate in resource-rich areas, i.e. where there are higher concentrations of large containers and/or humans per habitation. We analysed data from pupal surveys and mark-release-recapture experiments (non-blood-fed females were released) carried out in two dengue endemic neighbourhoods of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil: Tubiacanga (a suburb, with a human density of 337 inhabitants/ha) and Favela do Amorim (a slum, with a human density of 901 inhabitants/ha). In both areas, host-seeking females of three different release cohorts showed an overall non-uniform and extensive dispersal from their release point within 1-2 days post-release. At 4-5 days post-release, when many of the released females would be expected to be gravid, in Tubiacanga most mosquitoes were collected in areas with a relatively higher density of containers/premise, independently of the density of residents/house, whereas in Favela do Amorim, almost half of the captured mosquitoes were collected in relatively resource-poorer areas. Although Ae. aegypti dispersal patterns varied between sites, overall the distances travelled from the release point and the cumulative flight directions were correlated with the density of containers and hosts, more markedly in Tubiacanga than in Favela do Amorim.","[Maciel-de-Freitas, R.] Fiocruz MS, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Lab Transmissores Hematozoarios, Inst Oswaldo Cruz, BR-21040900 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Souza-Santos, R.] Fiocruz MS, Dept Endemias, Escola Nacl Saude Publ Sergio Arouca, BR-21040900 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Codeco, C.

It is also a phenomenon that pertains to the realm of community ecology, since blood-feeding patterns of vectors can occur across a community of vertebrate hosts. Although great advances in knowledge of the genetic basis for blood-feeding choices have been reported for selected vector species, little is known about the role of community composition of vertebrate hosts in determining such patterns. Methods & Results: Here, we present an analysis of feeding patterns of vectors across a variety of locations, looking at foraging patterns of communities of mosquitoes, across communities of hosts primarily comprised of mammals and birds. Using null models of species co-occurrence, which do not require ancillary information about host abundance, we found that blood-feeding patterns were aggregated in studies from multiple sites, but random in studies from a single site. This combination of results supports the idea that mosquito species in a community may rely primarily on host availability in a given landscape, and that contacts with specific hosts will be influenced more by the presence/absence of hosts than by innate mosquito choices. This observation stresses the importance of blood-feeding plasticity as a key trait explaining the emergence of many zoonotic mosquito transmitted diseases. Discussion: From an epidemiological perspective our observations support the idea that phenomena promoting synchronization of vectors and hosts can promote the emergence of vector-borne zoonotic diseases, as suggested by observations on the linkages between deforestation and the emergence of several human diseases.","[Chaves, Luis F.; Kitron, Uriel D.] Emory Univ, Dept Environm Studies, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Harrington, Laura C.] Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Keogh, Carolyn L.] Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Nguyen, Andy M.] Columbia Univ, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, Div Epidemiol, New York, NY 10032 USA","Chaves, LF (corresponding author), Emory Univ, Dept Environm Studies, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",lfchave@emory.edu,"Chaves, Luis Fernando/F-3448-2010","Chaves, Luis Fernando/0000-0002-5301-2764",American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (LFC); Emory University; NSF Ecology of Infectious Disease [0840403],"This work was funded by a Gorgas Research Award from the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (LFC), Emory University and NSF Ecology of Infectious Disease Grant 0840403.

The spatially defined focus, or nidus, of transmission may be characterized by vegetation as well as by climate, latitude, elevation, and geology. The ecological complexity, dimensions, and temporal stability of the nidus are determined largely by pathogen natural history and vector bionomics. Host populations, transmission efficiency, and therefore pathogen amplification vary spatially, thereby creating a heterogeneous surface that may be defined by remote sensing and statistical tools. The current review describes the evolution of landscape epidemiology as a science and exemplifies selected aspects by contrasting the ecology of two different recent disease outbreaks in North America caused by West Nile virus, ail explosive, highly virulent mosquito-borne virus producing ephemeral nidi, and Borrelia burgdorferi, a slowly amplifying chronic pathogen producing semipermanent nidi.","[Reisen, William K.] Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Vectorborne Dis, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Reisen, William K.] Univ Calif Davis, Sch Vet Med, Dept Pathol Microbiol & Immunol, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Reisen, WK (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Vectorborne Dis, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",wkreisen@ucdavis.edu,,,,,,134,178,180,2,113,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",0066-4170,1545-4487,,ANNU REV ENTOMOL,Annu.

Effectiveness of treated nets depends on direct impacts on individual mosquitoes including killing and excite-repellency, which vary considerably among vector species due to variations in host-seeking behaviours. While monitoring and evaluation programmes of ITNs have focuses on morbidity and all-cause mortality in humans, local entomological context receives little attention. Without knowing the dynamics of local vector species and their responses to treated nets, it is difficult to predict clinical outcomes when ITN applications are scaled up across African continent. Sound model frameworks incorporating intricate interactions between mosquitoes and treated nets are needed to develop the predictive capacity for scale-up applications of ITNs. Methods: An established agent-based model was extended to incorporate the direct outcomes, e. g. killing and avoidance, of individual mosquitoes exposing to ITNs in a hypothetical village setting with 50 houses and 90 aquatic habitats. Individual mosquitoes were tracked throughout the life cycle across the landscape. Four levels of coverage, i.e. 40, 60, 80 and 100%, were applied at the household level with treated houses having only one bed net. By using Latin hypercube sampling scheme, parameters governing killing, diverting and personal protection of net users were evaluated for their relative roles in containing mosquito populations, entomological inoculation rates (EIRs) and malaria incidence. Results: There were substantial gaps in coverage between households and individual persons, and 100% household coverage resulted in circa 50% coverage of the population. The results show that applications of ITNs could give rise to varying impacts on population-level metrics depending on values of parameters governing interactions of mosquitoes and treated nets at the individual level. The most significant factor in determining effectiveness was killing capability of treated nets. Strong excito-repellent effect of impregnated nets might lead to higher risk exposure to non-bed net users. Conclusion: With variabilities of vector mosquitoes in host-seeking behaviours and the responses to treated nets, it is anticipated that scale-up applications of INTs might produce varying degrees of success dependent on local entomological and epidemiological contexts. This study highlights that increased ITN coverage led to significant reduction in risk exposure and malaria incidence only when treated nets yielded high killing effects. It is necessary to test efficacy of treated nets on local dominant vector mosquitoes, at least in laboratory, for monitoring and evaluation of ITN programmes.","[Gu, Weidong; Novak, Robert J.] Univ Alabama, Div Infect Dis, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA","Gu, WD (corresponding author), Univ Alabama, Div Infect Dis, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA.",wgu@uab.edu; rjnovak@uab.edu,,,US National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [UO1 A154889],We thank one reviewer for his/her critical comments and suggestions.

Human intrusion into these former remote habitats through deforestation and bush meat hunting leads to an increased contact between humans and wildlife, and between humans and insect vectors (Leendertz et al., 2006; Jones et al., 2008; Gillespie et al., 2009). In the course of our research on pathogen transmission in this type of ecosystem, samples from non-human primates and other nammalian hosts living in tropical rainforests as well as humans living around rainforests are collected and analysed at the Robert Koch-Institut. One of the aims of our studies is to evaluate the risk of emergence of new zoonoses in the human population. We specifically focus on screening humans with high exposure to blood and organs of wild primates through bushmeat hunting and handling, but pathogen transmission from other possible hosts are also analysed. Chimpanzees can be seen as a natural system to study disease transmission among primates. In the last years we have shown that simian retroviruses, such as the Simian T-Cell Leukemia Virus-1 (STLV-1) and Foamy-Viruses (SFV) are transmitted from one non-human primate to another. Based on molecular epidemiological findings as well as prevalence data in different age classes of wild chimpanzees, we could show that the main transmission of these viruses is through the hunter-prey relationship that exists between red colobus monkeys and chimpanzees (Leendertz et al., 2004a, b; Leendertz et al., 2008). These findings in wild primates, which are known to be hunted by humans, inspired us to perform a study focused on the human population in the area together with the Institut Pasteur Cote d'Ivoire, and we found evidence of virus transmission from non-human primates to humans. Furthermore, we investigated several outbreaks of respiratory diseases in wild chimpanzees. In necropsy samples from deceased chimpanzees we detected two new strains of S. pneumoniae (Chi et al., 2007). In addition, the chimpanzees were infected with human paramyxoviruses (Kondgen et al., 2008). This was the first description of anthropoozonotic transmission of human respiratory viruses to great apes, identifying that human diseases are an important threat to these endangered species. In order to investigate the influence of ecological changes on the prevalence of mosquitoes and arboviruses, we systematically captured mosquitoes in and around tropical rainforests with different degrees of ecological changes. Firstly, we detected new viruses of the families Flavi-, Bunya- and Coronaviruses (Junglen et al., 2009), Secondly, we could show that ecological changes had a dramatic influence on the distribution and prevalence of mosquito and viruses, indicating that disturbance of the rainforest increases the risk of transmission of arboviruses to the human population (Junglen et al., in print).","[Leendertz, Fabian] Robert Koch Inst, Nachwuchsgrp Neuartige Zoonosen 2, D-13353 Berlin, Germany","Leendertz, F (corresponding author), Robert Koch Inst, Res Grp Emerging Zoonoses, Nordufer 20, D-13353 Berlin, Germany.",leendertzf@rki.de,"Leendertz, Fabian Hubertus/H-8902-2019",,,,,9,0,0,2,26,SCHLUETERSCHE VERLAGSGESELLSCHAFT MBH & CO KG,HANNOVER,"HANS-BOCKLER-ALLEE 7, 30173 HANNOVER, GERMANY",0005-9366,,,BERL MUNCH TIERARZTL,Berliner Munchener Tierarztl.

In order to better understand how deforestation affects the prevalence of vector-borne infectious diseases in wildlife, nine paired sites were sampled (disturbed vs. undisturbed habitats) in Southern Cameroon. We studied the diversity, prevalence and distribution of avian malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp.) and other related haemosporidians (species of Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon) from these sites in two widespread species of African rainforest birds, the yellow-whiskered greenbul (Andropadus latirostris, Pycnonotidae) and the olive sunbird (Cyanomitra olivacea, Nectariniidae). Twenty-six mitochondrial cytochrome b lineages were identified: 20 Plasmodium lineages and 6 Haemoproteus lineages. These lineages showed no geographic specificity, nor significant differences in lineage diversity between habitat types. However, we found that the prevalence of Leucocytozoon and Haemoproteus infections were significantly higher in undisturbed than in deforested habitats (Leucocytozoon spp. 50.3% vs. 35.8%, Haemoproteus spp. 16.3% vs. 10.8%). We also found higher prevalence for all haemosporidian parasites in C. olivacea than in A. latirostris species (70.2% vs. 58.2%). Interestingly, we found one morphospecies of Plasmodium in C. olivacea, as represented by a clade of related lineages, showed increased prevalence at disturbed sites, while another showed a decrease, testifying to different patterns of transmission, even among closely related lineages of avian malaria, in relation to deforestation. Our work demonstrates that anthropogenic habitat change can affect host-parasite systems and result in opposing trends in prevalence of haemosporidian parasites in wild bird populations.","[Chasar, Anthony; Loiseau, Claire; Sehgal, Ravinder N.

Disturbed and fragmented habitats allow some vector mosquitoes to thrive. The New Zealand landscape has been extensively modified since the arrival of humans, and there is accumulating evidence that the distribution of mosquitoes is being altered as a result of anthropogenic environmental changes. This study aimed to assess whether forest habitat size affected the community composition of mosquitoes, and whether the density of the introduced brushtail possum would benefit exotic mosquito species that feed primarily on mammal hosts. Extensive sampling of the mosquito community was carried out using dry ice-baited light traps, oviposition traps, and larval surveys. The results provided the first experimental evidence in New Zealand that changes in forest habitat size affect the indigenous and introduced mosquito fauna differently. The proportion of native species making up the mosquito community appears to be steadily reduced as native forest habitats become smaller. In contrast, the opposite pattern appears to occur for the introduced vector Aedes notoscriptus. Although there was a trend indicating that possums may have a negative impact on a native species (Culex pervigilans), the impact of these animals on the mosquito fauna remains unclear. The evidence suggests that the conservation of large pristine forest ecosystems in New Zealand could have human health implications.","[Derraik, Jose G.

To investigate biotic and abiotic factors associated with disease incidence, cases of reported human disease caused by West Nile virus ( WNV) in the state of Iowa were aggregated by census block groups in Iowa for the years 2002 - 2006. Spatially explicit data on landscape, demographic, and climatic conditions were collated and analyzed by census block groups. Statistical tests of differences between means and distributions of landscape, demographic, and climatic variables for census block groups with and without WNV disease incidence were carried out. Entomological data from Iowa were considered at the state level to add context to the potential ecological events taking place. Results: Numerous statistically significant differences were shown in the means and distributions of various landscape and demographic variables for census block groups with and without WNV disease incidence. Census block groups with WNV disease incidence had significantly lower population densities than those without. Landscape variables showing differences included stream density, road density, land cover compositions, presence of irrigation, and presence of animal feeding operations. Statistically significant differences in the annual means of precipitations, dew point, and minimum temperature for both the year of WNV disease incidence and the prior year, were detected in at least one year of the analysis for each parameter. However, the differences were not consistent between years. Conclusion: The analysis of human WNV disease incidence by census block groups in Iowa demonstrated unique landscape, demographic, and climatic associations. Our results indicate that multiple ecological WNV transmission dynamics are most likely taking place in Iowa. In 2003 and 2006, drier conditions were associated with WNV disease incidence. In a significant novel finding, rural agricultural settings were shown to be strongly associated with human WNV disease incidence in Iowa.","[DeGroote, John P.; Sugumaran, Ramanathan] Univ No Iowa, Dept Geog, GeoInformat Training Res Educ & Extens Ctr, Cedar Falls, IA 50614 USA; [Brend, Sarah M.] Iowa Dept Publ Hlth, Des Moines, IA 50319 USA; [Tucker, Brad J.; Bartholomay, Lyric C.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Entomol, Ames, IA USA","DeGroote, JP (corresponding author), Univ No Iowa, Dept Geog, GeoInformat Training Res Educ & Extens Ctr, Cedar Falls, IA 50614 USA.",john.degroote@uni.edu; sugu@uni.edu; SBrend@idph.state.ia.us; bjtucker@iastate.edu; lyricb@iastate.edu,,,,,,40,20,20,0,5,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1476-072X,,,INT J HEALTH GEOGR,Int.

Efficacy of replicate applications was evaluated by measuring mortality among caged sentinel mosquitoes, by evaluating changes in host-seeking abundance at replicated dry ice-baited traps positioned along intersecting east-west and north-south transects, and by differential recapture patterns of marked females released near traps in the sprayed central core and unsprayed control areas. Sentinel mortality agreed well with estimates of droplet density measured by slide spinners and was affected by 1) distance of cages from the truck route; 2) landscape features, such as tree lines that created wind shadows; 3) irregular landscape that disrupted the particle cloud; 4) low wind speed that failed to carry the droplet cloud through the environment; and 5) failure of the droplets to penetrate dead airspace within stands of vegetation. Despite variable sentinel mortality, Culex tarsalis relative abundance in rural landscapes within and around our study areas always declined after ULV applications. Concurrent decreases in abundance at traps within sprayed and adjoining unsprayed areas confounded our estimates of percentage of control using Mulla's formula, which compares abundance in sprayed and unsprayed areas pre- and postspray. ULV applications significantly affected recapture patterns, in that recapture rates within the spray zone usually were significantly less than in the unsprayed zone. Collectively, our data indicated that ground ULV applications measurably reduced Cx. tarsalis abundance in rural areas of the Coachella Valley but that further evaluations may be necessary to validate efficacy on Culex quinquefasciatus populations in residential communities.","Univ Calif Davis, Sch Vet Med, Ctr Vectorborne Dis, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Sch Vet Med, Dept Pathol Microbiol & Immunol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Coachella Valley Mosquito & Vector Control Dist, Indio, CA 92201 USA","Reisen, WK (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Sch Vet Med, Ctr Vectorborne Dis, Old Davis Rd, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",,,,"NIAID NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [AI058267] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [U01AI058267, U01AI058267, U01AI058267, U01AI058267, U01AI058267] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",,,25,19,19,0,11,AMER MOSQUITO CONTROL ASSOC,EATONTOWN,"P O BOX 234, EATONTOWN, NJ 07724-0234 USA",8756-971X,,,J AM MOSQUITO CONTR,J.

We used specific physiological and behavioral ecology bird data, and Po'ouli morphological and spectral data obtained from museum specimens to address ecological and conservation-related questions about the Po'ouli that are other-wise very difficult to quantify. Laboratory and field tested microclimate and biophysical-behavioral animal computer models were integrated with remote sensing technologies. To show that the generic microclimate and enclotherm models can predict metabolic and water loss requirements of Hawaiian Honeycreepers, we used the 2 species with known physiological properties, the Hawaiian Amakihi, Hemignathus virens, and the Hawaiian Anianiau, Hemignathus parvus. Predictions were within experimental measurement error of the laboratory measurements. Then using field rather than laboratory conditions as input data, we predict the field distribution of the Amakihi on Maui as the first spatial test of the models applied to birds. Results are consistent with Amakihi field distribution data. Fossils show that the Po'ouli once lived on Maui at low elevations in dry/mesic habitats on a likely diet of native tree snails and insects. The arrival of lethal mosquito-borne avian malaria in Hawaii exterminated low elevation Po'ouli forcing a population shift to mountain rainforests and possibly a snail diet instead of insects. To explore the maximum consequences of such a diet shift we assumed exclusive diets of snails versus insects at both low and high elevations. Snail diets require similar to 4 times higher foraging rates than do insect diets, making a predominantly snail diet an unlikely prospect for the Po'ouli. Landscape scale simulations suggest that a snail diet would force a Po'ouli distribution inconsistent with observations. A predominantly insect diet is consistent with distribution observations. We show that as local environmental conditions change across the landscape in space and diurnal/seasonal time it is possible to quantify animal physiological and behavioral consequences of those variations in their local environment. This enables quantification of the requisite spatial and temporal distribution and amount or availability of resources that may affect species' potential for survival, growth, reproduction and distribution.","Univ Wisconsin, Dept Zool, Madison, WI 53706 USA; Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Bot, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA","Porter, WP (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Zool, 250 N Mills St, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",wpporter@wisc.edu,,,,,,51,32,33,1,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1540-7063,1557-7023,,INTEGR COMP BIOL,Integr.

Two species [great egret (Ardea alba) and snowy egret (Egretta thula)] nest in mixed-species colonies on islands in Narragansett Bay and regularly forage in adjacent salt marshes. We surveyed 13 salt marshes approximately twice weekly during the breeding and post-breeding seasons in 2001 and 2002. Based on resource selection functions, foraging great and snowy egrets strongly preferred pools within salt marshes, while mosquito control ditches were rarely used. Foraging egrets were never detected in stands of common reed (Phragmites australis). The number of egrets using individual marshes varied considerably, although density estimates were far less variable. Salt marsh area was better at predicting the mean number of foraging egrets using a marsh than landscape-level parameters, such as distance to the nearest nesting colony or the total area of salt marsh within 5 km. Carefully designed salt marsh restoration projects could benefit local egret populations because it appears that foraging habitat availability may be a limiting factor. To ensure use by foraging egrets, salt marsh restoration designs should increase the availability of pool and open water habitat, reduce common reed, and modify deep ditches and channels to make them more accessible for foraging egrets.","Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Nat Resources Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA","Trocki, CL (corresponding author), 95 Clinton Ave, Jamestown, RI 02835 USA.",cltrocki@verizon.net,,,EPAUnited States Environmental Protection Agency [R829384] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER,,,29,18,18,2,28,SOC WETLAND SCIENTISTS,LAWRENCE,"810 E TENTH ST, P O BOX 1897, LAWRENCE, KS 66044 USA",0277-5212,,,WETLANDS,Wetlands,JUN,2006,26,2,,,,,307,312,,10.1672/0277-5212(2006)26[307:AHSBFE]2.0.CO;2,,,6,Ecology; Environmental Sciences,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,058YY,WOS:000238701700003,,,,,2020-12-20,

Thus, heterogeneity in human biting reflects underlying spatial heterogeneity in the distribution and suitability of larval habitat as well as inherent differences in the attractiveness, suitability and distribution of blood-meal hosts. One of the possible strategies of malaria control is to identify local vector species and then attack water bodies that contain their larvae. Methods: Biting and host seeking, not oviposition, have been the focus of most previous studies of mosquitoes and malaria transmission. This study presents a mathematical model that incorporates mosquito oviposition behaviour. Results: The model demonstrates that oviposition is one potential factor explaining heterogeneous biting and vector distribution in a landscape with a heterogeneous distribution of larval habitat. Adult female mosquitoes tend to aggregate around places where they oviposit, thereby increasing the risk of malaria, regardless of the suitability of the habitat for larval development. Thus, a water body may be unsuitable for adult mosquito emergence, but simultaneously, be a source for human malaria. Conclusion: Larval density may be a misleading indicator of a habitat's importance for malaria control. Even if mosquitoes could be lured to oviposit in sprayed larval habitats, this would not necessarily mitigate - and might aggravate - the risk of malaria transmission. Forcing mosquitoes to fly away from humans in search of larval habitat may be a more efficient way to reduce the risk of malaria than killing larvae. Thus, draining, fouling, or filling standing water where mosquitoes oviposit can be more effective than applying larvicide.","NIH, Fogarty Int Ctr, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; Univ Paris 06, INSERM, U707, F-75012 Paris, France","Le Menach, A (corresponding author), NIH, Fogarty Int Ctr, Bldg 10, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",lemenach@u707.jussieu.fr; mckenzel@mail.nih.gov; flahault@u707.jussieu.fr; smitdave@helix.nih.gov,"Smith, David L/L-8850-2013","Smith, David L/0000-0003-4367-3849",Intramural NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [Z99 TW999999] Funding Source: Medline,,,58,89,91,0,17,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1475-2875,,MALARIA J,Malar.

We experimentally examined the relative impact of native and introduced predatory fish on a temporary wetland amphibian assemblage to determine whether these predators exert distinct (unique or non-substitutable) or equivalent (similar) impacts on prey. Predatory fish included the eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki), golden topminnow (Fundulus chrysotus), flagfish (Jordanella floridae), and the introduced walking catfish (Clarias batrachus). The tadpole assemblage included four common species known to co-occur in temporary wetlands in south-central Florida, USA: the oak toad (Bufo quercicus), pinewoods treefrog (Hyla femoralis), squirrel treefrog (Hyla squirella), and eastern narrowmouth toad (Gastrophryne carolinensis). Tadpoles were exposed to different predators in wading pools under conditions similar to those found in surrounding temporary wetlands (particularly in terms of substrate type, the degree of habitat complexity, and temperature). Native predators were similar with respect to predation rate and prey selectivity, suggesting similar energy requirements and foraging behavior. Conversely, native fish predators, especially G. holbrooki, were distinct from the introduced C. batrachus. In contrast to expectations, C. batrachus were less voracious predators than native fish, particularly G. holbrooki. Moreover, survival of G. carolinensis and H. femoralis were higher in the presence of C. batrachus than G. holbrooki. We suggest that C. batrachus was a less efficient predator than native fish because the foraging behavior of this species resulted in low predator-prey encounter rates, and thus predation rate. In combination with a related field study, our results suggest that native predatory fish play a stronger role than C. batrachus in influencing the spatial distribution and abundance of temporary wetland amphibians in the landscape.","Univ New Hampshire, Dept Nat Resources, Durham, NH 03824 USA; Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Miami, FL 33199 USA","Baber, MJ (corresponding author), Univ New Hampshire, Dept Nat Resources, Durham, NH 03824 USA.",matthew.baber@unh.edu,,,,,,40,51,55,1,46,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUL,2003,136,2,,,,,289,295,,10.1007/s00442-003-1251-2,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,700BJ,WOS:000184092500014,12712313,,,,2020-12-20,

By classifying the landscape from aerial photographs within a 2-km-diameter circle centered on each colony site, we found no significant relationships between habitat type near a colony site and cliff swallow colony size or mosquito abundance. Proximity to livestock could not account for our results. Culex tarsalis was proportionately more likely to be caught inside a colony than at traps 30 m away, but the proportion of C. tarsalis inside a colony did not vary with colony size.

The abundance, activity, shell selection and behaviour of three species of hermit crab are related to the level of mangrove cover. With increased density of mangrove trees, the study species of hermit crab changed in abundance, tended to become diurnal, spent more time feeding and were clustered in larger groups when doing so, and selected longer spired shells. All five of the same variables are also linked to the proximity and activity of humans through both direct and indirect actions. Direct effects included a tendency to nocturnal activity with proximity to human activity; indirect effects included increased and more clumped food supplies, and shell middens from intertidal harvesting and deforestation. Mangroves are important to local human populations as well as to hermit crabs, for a wide variety of (similar) reasons. Mangroves provide storm shelter, fisheries and fishery nursery grounds for adjacent human settlements, but they also harbour mosquito populations and their removal provides valuable building materials and fuel. Hermit crabs may be useful (indirectly) to coastal human populations by being a source of food to certain commercial species, and by quickly consuming rotting/discarded food and faeces (thereby reducing disease and pests). They can also cause minor problems to coastal human populations because they use shells of (fisheries) target mollusc species and can be more abundant than the living molluscs, thereby slowing down effective hand collection through confusion over identification. The mixture of positive and negative attributes that the three groups impart to each other in the Quirimba Archipelago. northern Mozambique, is discussed.","Univ Coll Cork, Dept Zool & Anim Ecol, Cork, Ireland; Frontier Soc Expt Explorat, London, England","Barnes, DKA (corresponding author), Univ Coll Cork, Dept Zool & Anim Ecol, Cork, Ireland.",,,,,,,28,12,12,1,16,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0141-6707,,,AFR J ECOL,Afr.

Vegetation and other landscape features used by roosting or nesting birds at night dictate their exposure to nocturnally active host-seeking Culex tarsalis Coquillett and therefore to western equine encephalomyelitis and St. Louis encephalitis viruses. Precipitin tests on 645 Cx. tarsalis that were collected resting and host-seeking near the Salton Sea in Coachella Valley, CA, indicated that passeriform birds (64%) and rabbits (25%) were the most frequent bloodmeal hosts and that the percentage of females feeding on birds varied temporally as an inverse function of mosquito abundance. Blood meals were not taken from communally roosting water birds. The spatial distribution of host-seeking females then was investigated by deploying dry ice baited traps within seven sites representative of habitats found along the Salton Sea. Mosquito catch was greatest at traps within elevated vegetation such as Tamarisk, mesquite, cattails, and orchards and lowest at traps positioned at snags over water, sand bars, open fields, and within housing in a small rural community. These data indicate that host-seeking Cx. tarsalis females congregated at specific landscape features that were not necessarily associated with large concentrations of potential bloodmeal hosts.","Univ Calif Davis, Sch Vet Med, Ctr Vector Borne Dis Res, Arbovirus Res Unit, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Reisen, WK (corresponding author), Arbovirus Field Stn, 4705 Allen Rd, Bakersfield, CA 93312 USA.",,,,"NIAID NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [1-R01-AI 32939] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R01AI032939, R01AI032939, R01AI032939] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",,,23,41,42,3,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0022-2585,1938-2928,,J MED ENTOMOL,J.

Each environmental change, whether occurring as a natural phenomenon or through human intervention, changes the ecological balance and context within which disease hosts or vectors and parasites breed, develop, and transmit disease. Each species occupies a particular ecological niche and vector species sub-populations are distinct behaviourally and genetically as they adapt to man-made environments. Most zoonotic parasites display three distinct life cycles: sylvatic, zoonotic, and anthroponotic. In adapting to changed environmental conditions, including reduced non human population and increased human population, some vectors display conversion from a primarily zoophyllic to primarily anthrophyllic orientation. Deforestation and ensuing changes in landuse, human settlement, commercial development, road construction, water control systems (dams, canals, irrigation systems, reservoirs), and climate, singly, and in combination have been accompanied by global increases in morbidity and mortality from emergent parasitic disease. The replacement of forests with crop farming, ranching, and raising small animals can create supportive habitats for parasites and their host vectors. When the landuse of deforested areas changes, the pattern of human settlement is altered and habitat fragmentation may provide opportunities for exchange and transmission of parasites to the heretofore uninfected humans. Construction of water control projects can lead to shifts in such vector populations as snails and mosquitoes and their parasites. Construction of roads in previously inaccessible forested areas can lead to erosion, and stagnant ponds by blocking the Row of streams when the water rises during the rainy season. The combined effects of environmentally detrimental changes in local landuse and alterations in global climate disrupt the natural ecosystem and can increase the risk of transmission of parasitic diseases to the human population.

Overall, 74 WEE and one SLE isolates were obtained from 222,455 Cx. tarsalis females tested in 4,988 pools. In addition, 133 and 40 seroconversions were detected in 28 chicken flocks, and 143 and 27 of 20,192 sera tested from 149 species of wild birds were positive for antibodies to WEE and SLE, respectively. WEE was active in all three valleys, whereas SLE only was detected in Coachella Valley. Seroconversions in sentinel chickens provided the most sensitive indication of enzootic activity and were correlated with seroprevalence rates in wild birds. Avian seroprevalence rates did not provide an early warning of pending enzootic activity. in chickens, because positive sera from after hatching year birds collected during spring most probably were the result of infections acquired during the previous season. Few seroconversions were detected among banded recaptured birds collected during spring and early summer. Age and resident status, but not sex, were significant risk factors for wild bird infection, with the highest seroprevalence rates among after hatching year individuals of permanent resident species. Migrants (with the exception of mourning doves) and winter resident species rarely were positive. House finches, house sparrows, Gambel's quail, California quail, common ground doves, and mourning doves were most frequently positive for antibodies. The initial detection of enzootic activity each summer coincided closely with the appearance of hatching year birds of these species in our study areas, perhaps indicating their role in virus amplification. Bird species most frequently positive roosted or nested in elevated upland vegetation, sites where Cx. tarsalis host-seeking females hunt most frequently. These serosurveys provided important background information for planned host competence and chronic infection studies.","Univ Calif Davis, Sch Vet Med, Ctr Vector Borne Dis Res, Arbovirus Res Unit, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Reisen, WK (corresponding author), Arbovirus Field Stn, 4705 Allen Rd, Bakersfield, CA 93312 USA.",,"MEDRANO, Vicente/AAW-3249-2020","MEDRANO, Vicente/0000-0003-1839-0150","NIAID NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [1-R01-AI 32939] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R01AI032939, R01AI032939, R01AI032939] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",,,67,54,55,0,9,ENTOMOL SOC AMER,LANHAM,"9301 ANNAPOLIS RD, LANHAM, MD 20706 USA",0022-2585,,,J MED ENTOMOL,J.

Most red-winged blackbird parameters examined varied annually and some differences were found before treatments began. In all cases, differences found before treatments were either found again during the treatment years or no patterns existed to suggest impacts of mosquito control treatments. Only 1 of the 22 variables examined indicated a significant difference between a treatment group and the controls; males in Bti-treated sites were larger than males in control sires during the treatment years. Clutch size indicated a significant treatment-by-year interaction and was higher in control areas as compared with Bti-treated areas in 3 of the 6 years of study; 2 years occurred before any treatments were applied. Data from benthic aquatic insect studies showed that aquatic insects were depressed in wetlands treated with both methoprene and Bti In July and August. However, it is unlikely that food available to avian species in these wetlands was lower during the breeding season (May and June). Other portions of the avian life cycle that may be affected include the dispersal of young birds within or to these sites and individuals that use wetlands during migration. Impacts on these aspects of the avian community and landscape-level effects of treatments were not addressed.","UNIV MINNESOTA, DEPT MATH & STAT, DULUTH, MN 55812 USA","Hanowski, JM (corresponding author), UNIV MINNESOTA, NAT RESOURCES RES INST, CTR WATER & ENVIRONM, 5013 MILLER TRUNK HIGHWAY, DULUTH, MN 55811 USA.",,,,,,,17,10,11,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0730-7268,1552-8618,,ENVIRON TOXICOL CHEM,Environ.

Of 85,197 anophelines collected in 1,276 paired indoor and outdoor landing catches, 40.4% were Anopheles koliensis Owen, 36.7% An. punctulatus Donitz, 14.3% An. karwari (James), 4.9% An. farauti s.l. Laveran, 3.1% An, longirostris Brug, and 0.7% An. bancroftii Giles. Maps of average indoor biting rates were produced using a Bayesian conditional autoregressive model which allowed for heterogeneities in sampling effort over time and space. Differences in spatial distributions among species were observed among and within villages and were related to the distribution of larval habitats and vegetation. Abundance of An. punctulatus and An. koliensis decreased with distance from the main waterway and probably from a sage swamp forest at 6 villages in North Wosera. Abundance of An. punctulatus was associated negatively with those of An. farauti s.l., An. longirostris, and An. bancroftii. The latter 3 species also had relatively low ratios of indoor-to-outdoor biting rates, and earlier biting times than An. punctulatus. Human blood indices of at least 0.79 were observed for all species except An. bancroftii. Abundance of all 6 species was correlated temporally with recent rainfall, but An. koliensis, An. karwari, and An. longirostris showed greater temporal variability than the other species. An. punctulatus and An. koliensis tended to occur together in time and space (index of association, I=0.85). Weaker associations were seen between An. farauti s.l, and An. longirostris (I=0.44) and An. koliensis and An. karwari (I=0.34). The most frequently collected species occurred together and were concentrated near the Amugu river; the remaining species tended to occur together but in different parts of the Wosera area.

Selected examples are considered from viral and parasitic infections (arboviruses, malaria, filariases, Chagas Disease and schistosomiasis) where disease patterns have been directly or indirectly influenced by loss of natural tropical forests. A wide range of activities have resulted in deforestation. These include colonisation and settlement, transmigrant programmes, logging, agricultural activities to provide for cash crops, mining, hydropower development and fuelwood collection. Each activity influences the prevalence, incidence and distribution of vector-borne disease. Three main regions are considered - South America, West & Central Africa and South-East Asia. In each, documented changes in vector ecology and behaviour and disease pattern have occurred. Such changes result from human activity at the forest interface and within the forest. They include both deforestation and reafforestation programmes. Deforestation, or activities associated with it, have produced new habitats for Anopheles darlingi mosquitoes and have caused malaria epidemics in South America. The different species complexes in South-East Asia (A. dirus, A. minimus, A. balabacensis) have been affected in different ways by forest clearance with different impacts on malaria incidence. The ability of zoophilic vectors to adapt to human blood as an alternative source of food and to become associated with human dwellings (peridomestic behaviour) have influenced the distribution of the leishmaniases in South America. Certain species of sandflies (Lutzomyia intermedia, Lu. longipalpis, Lu. whitmani), which were originally zoophilic and sylvatic, have adapted to feeding on humans in peridomestic and even periurban situations. The changes in behaviour of reservoir hosts and the ability of pathogens to adapt to new reservoir hosts in the newly-created habitats also influence the patterns of disease. In anthroponotic infections, such as Plasmodium, Onchocerca and Wuchereria, changes in disease patterns and vector ecology may be more difficult to detect. Detailed knowledge of vector species and species complexes is needed in relation to changing climate associated with deforestation. The distributions of the Anopheles gambiae and Simulium damnosum species complexes in West Africa are examples. There have been detailed longitudinal studies of Anopheles gambiae populations in different ecological zones of West Africa. Studies on Simulium damnosum cytoforms (using chromosome identification methods) in the Onchocerciasis Control Programme were necessary to detect changes in distribution of species in relation to changed habitats. These examples underline the need for studies on the taxonomy of medically-important insects in parallel with long-term observations on changing habitats. In some circumstances destruction of the forest has reduced or even removed disease transmission (e.g. S. neavei-transmitted Onchocerca in Kenya). Whilst the process of deforestation can be expected to continue, hopefully at a decreased rate, it is expected that unpredictable and sometimes rapid changes in disease patterns will pose problems for the public health services.","UNIV LIVERPOOL,LIVERPOOL SCH TROP MED,PEMBROKE PL,LIVERPOOL L3 5QA,ENGLAND",,,,,,,,154,193,208,0,107,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"40 WEST 20TH STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10011-4211",0031-1820,,,PARASITOLOGY,Parasitology,,1993,106,,,S,,,S55,S75,,10.1017/S0031182000086121,,,21,Parasitology,Parasitology,KZ056,WOS:A1993KZ05600007,8488073,,,,2020-12-20,
