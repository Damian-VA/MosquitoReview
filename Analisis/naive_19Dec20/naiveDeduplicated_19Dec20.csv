Most recent severe outbreaks have occurred in Indian Ocean islands of R√©union and Mauritius and India. There is no specific drug treatment for the disease, neither is there a standardized vaccine available for prevention of the disease. The present review gives a global perspective on patents filed pertaining to chikungunya. The United States has been the top patent filing jurisdiction followed by China, Europe, and India. The patents have been classified into categories of therapeutics, diagnostics, and vaccines. Maximum patent documents fall under the therapeutics category, in which patent applications are predominantly related to chemically derived drugs. They include nucleic acid analogues, various other host and virus enzyme/protein inhibitors. Patents on biological or plant derived drugs are being filed relatively recently. In the category of diagnostics, immunoassay based tests seemed to be of choice until the year 2005, whereas, patent filings for molecular diagnostics have now surpassed those with immunoassay techniques. In the vaccines category, vaccines based on viral vectors appear to be emerging as the preferred vaccine platform with the majority of patents filed in the years 2014-2017. Corporate sector has the most patent filings to its credit, followed closely by academic institutions. Pasteur Institut along with Chinese Agency for Science, Technology and Research is the top patent filing entity in chikungunya related technology space. Presently, nine vaccine products, three antiviral drugs and one mRNA based gene therapy are under development. Three vaccine products have been given fast track designation by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to expedite review and facilitate the development of a vaccine to prevent a serious or life-threatening condition and fill an unmet medical need. Similarly, one vaccine has been given PRIME (Priority Medicines) status by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). ¬© 2019 Elsevier B.V.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071296969&doi=10.1016%2fj.actatropica.2019.105131&partnerID=40&md5=59721434b1bb127f059d1012b9738acc","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/pubmed.csv",2

The reduction of malaria burden in endemic and epidemic regions mainly depends on knowledge of the malaria-transmitting mosquito species, populations and behavioural characteristics, as well as malaria exposure risks. This work aimed at carrying out a holistic study in order to characterise Anopheles species in relation to human malaria in seven wetlands along the lower section of the volcanic chain of Cameroon. Results: Eight malaria vectors: Anopheles arabiensis, An. coluzzii, An. funestus (s.s.), An. gambiae, An. hancocki, An. melas, An. nili and An. ziemanni, were found biting humans. Anopheles gambiae was widespread; however, it played a secondary role in the Ndop plain where An. ziemmani was the primary vector species (79.2%). Anophelines were more exophagic (73.6%) than endophagic (26.4%), showing a marked nocturnal activity (22:00-4:00 h) for An. coluzzii and An. gambiae while An. funestus (s.s.) was mostly caught between 1:00 and 6:00 h and An. ziemanni having an early evening biting behaviour (18:00-00:00 h). Female Anopheles were mostly observed to have relative high parity rates (‚â• 70%), with the exception of the Meanja site where species parity varies from 46 to 55%. Overall, the transmission level was low with entomological inoculation rates estimated to 0.7 infected bites per person per month (ib/p/mth) in Tiko and Ndop, 1.4 ib/p/mth in Mamfe and 2.24 ib/p/mth in Santchou. Conclusions: The present study represents detailed Anopheles vector characterisation from an understudied area along the volcanic chain of Cameroon with endemic malaria transmission. The significant differences in bionomics and Anopheles species distribution within the studied wetlands, highlights the importance of providing baseline data and an opportunity to assess the outcome of ongoing malaria control interventions in the country. ¬© 2018 The Author(s).","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85051481808&doi=10.1186%2fs13071-018-3041-z&partnerID=40&md5=45f787d57b25006a6997909d9bbdac62","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/pubmed.csv",2

Zoonotic vector-borne disease prevalence is affected by vector, human, and reservoir host factors, which are influenced by habitat and climate; these 5 components interact on microhabitat-to-landscape scales but are often analyzed at a single spatial scale. Methods. We present an information theoretic, multiscale, multiple regression analysis of the ecological drivers of Ross River virus. We analyze the spatial pattern of 20 years of Ross River virus infections from South Australia (1992-2012; n = 5261), using variables across these 5 components of disease ecology at 3 spatial scales. Results. We found that covariate importance depended on the spatial scale of the analysis; some biotic variables were more important at fine scales and some abiotic variables were more important at coarser spatial scales. The urban score of an area was most predictive of infections, and mosquito variables did not improve the explanatory power of these models. Conclusions. Through this multiscale analysis, we identified novel drivers of the spatial distribution of disease and recommend public health interventions. Our results underline that single-scale analyses may paint an incomplete picture of disease drivers, potentially creating a major flaw in epidemiological analyses. Multiscale, ecological analyses are needed to better understand infectious disease transmission. ¬© The 2017 Author(s).","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85044501471&doi=10.1093%2finfdis%2fjix615&partnerID=40&md5=a2d32d2c7354d520fe67801c7b23ca6b","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/pubmed.csv",2

DENV infection then proceeds stepwise through the mosquito from the midgut to the carcass, and ultimately to the salivary glands, where it is secreted into saliva and then transmitted anew on a subsequent bite. We examined viral kinetics in tissues of the Aedes aegypti mosquito over a finely graded time course, and as per previous studies, found that initial viral dose and serotype strain diversity control infectivity. We also found that a threshold level of virus is required to establish body-wide infections and that replication kinetics in the early and intermediate tissues do not predict those of the salivary glands. Our findings have implications for mosquito GMO design, modeling the contribution of transmission to vector competence and the role of mosquito kinetics in the overall DENV epidemiological landscape.

Discovery of new antimalarial drugs with novel chemotypes or modes of action lie at the heart of these efforts. There is a particular interest in drug candidates that target stages of the malaria parasite lifecycle beyond the symptomatic asexual blood stages. This is especially important given the spectre of emerging drug resistance to all current frontline antimalarials. One approach gaining increased interest is the potential of designing novel drugs that target parasite passage from infected individual to feeding mosquito and back again. Action of such therapeutics is geared much more at the population level rather than just concerned with the infected individual. The search for novel drugs active against these stages has been helped by improvements to in vitro culture of transmission and pre-erythrocytic parasite lifecycle stages, robotic automation and high content imaging, methodologies that permit the high-throughput screening (HTS) of compound libraries for drug discovery. Here, we review recent advances in the antimalarial screening landscape, focussed on transmission blocking as a key aim for drug-treatment campaigns of the future. ¬© 2019 The Authors","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062634295&doi=10.1016%2fj.cbpa.2019.01.029&partnerID=40&md5=3cc4cd732b3108a53da4117db0c27e63","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/pubmed.csv",2

Yellow fever vaccine production barely meets demands. In this review, we address the causes of the recent yellow fever outbreaks, why fractional dose yellow fever vaccination works, the role of virus neutralizing antibodies in the protection against yellow fever, and the need for revaccination. Recent findings: Human activities have profoundly changed the epidemiology of yellow fever. The excess of infectious viral particles in routine yellow fever vaccine batches allows for off-label use of fractional dose yellow fever vaccination in response to emergency situations. Two studies have confirmed long-term protection after fractional dose yellow fever vaccination. The need for the presence of virus neutralizing antibodies (VNA) to protect an individual against yellow fever depends on the epidemiological setting. In case of sylvatic transmission, population immunity is irrelevant for individual protection, as mosquitoes are transmitting the virus from infected nonhuman primates to human. Summary: With the growing connectivity through air travel, countries with high densities of nonimmune populations and of the urban mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti, should ensure that their citizens are properly vaccinated against yellow fever before traveling to a yellow fever endemic country. In the situation of sylvatic transmission, the presence of protective levels of VNA will determine the outcome and may require revaccination at some point in time.

We evaluated host utilization over a 3-month period in 2013 in a residential landscape in College Station, Texas. PCR sequencing of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase 1 gene permitted molecular identification of vertebrate bloodmeals to the species level. Forage ratio analysis identified bird species that were overutilized and underutilized by comparing community feeding index values to expected relative abundance values of bird species, derived from eBird data. Community feeding index values were also used in conjunction with reservoir competence data from the literature to generate reservoir capacity index values, a means of identifying relative importance of vertebrate reservoir hosts. Of 498 blood-engorged Cx. quinquefasciatus, 313 (62.9%) were identified to vertebrate species. The majority (95.5%) of bloodmeals originated from avian species with the remainder from mammals, but not humans. Northern mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos) was the principal host for mosquito feeding in June and July, but northern cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) became primary host in August. Forage ratio analysis revealed the overutilization of house finch (Haemorhous mexicanus), American robin (Turdus migratorius), northern mockingbird, northern cardinal, white-winged dove (Zenaida asiatica), and mourning dove (Zenaida macroura). Great-Tailed grackle (Quiscalus mexicanus), blue jay (Cyanocitta cristata), and Carolina wren (Thryothorus ludovicianus) were under-utilized relative to availability. Reservoir capacity calculations suggested that northern mockingbird and northern cardinal were the principal amplifiers in the study area. These data identify the primary avian species contributing to the enzootic amplification of WNV in East-Central Texas and reveal that the heavy feeding on moderately competent hosts and no feeding on humans likely limit epidemics in this region. ¬© Copyright 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85052888075&doi=10.1089%2fvbz.2018.2285&partnerID=40&md5=e3a0017e0a9816c2b360cbbef3ebc30c","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/pubmed.csv",2

Whether deforestation directly or indirectly affects the prevalence of avian haemosporidian parasites through their hosts and/or vectors is still not well understood. We sampled understory bird communities (insectivorous, frugivorous, granivorous and nectarivorous birds) and mosquitoes in three habitats showing a gradient of deforestation (pristine forest, fragmented forest, and young palm oil plantation), to assess the effects of habitat changes on avian haemosporidian (Plasmodium and Haemoproteus) prevalence and its relationship to bird feeding guilds and mosquito abundance. Blood samples of 845 individual birds belonging to 85 species and 27 families were collected in the three habitat types and screened using microscopy and PCR. Plasmodium infections were detected in 136 individuals (16.09%) and varied significantly among habitat types while Haemoproteus infections were detected in 98 individuals (11.60%) and did not vary significantly among habitat types. However, the prevalence of Plasmodium and Haemoproteus in bird feeding groups varied significantly among habitats. Nectarivorous and granivorous birds had the highest Plasmodium and Haemoproteus prevalence, respectively. The abundance of mosquitoes varied significantly among habitat types and the prevalence of Plasmodium significantly and positively correlated with mosquito abundance in fragmented forest. This study highlights the importance of host and mosquito determinants in the transmission dynamics of avian Plasmodium and Haemoproteus infections following habitat changes. Selective logging favored an increase in the prevalence of Plasmodium in insectivores, the prevalence of Haemoproteus in nectarivores and the abundance of female mosquitoes while, the establishment of the palm oil plantation favored an increase in the prevalence of Plasmodium in granivores and Haemoproteus in nectarivores. Species feeding behavior is also an important determinant to consider for a better understanding of patterns of parasite infections in a changing environment. ¬© 2019 Australian Society for Parasitology","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077358825&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijpara.2019.10.006&partnerID=40&md5=50e08bce572bb35001bdaebc8bd08b90","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/pubmed.csv",2

Large urban mosquito populations can represent a significant risk for transmission of emergent arboviral infection. However, even large mosquito populations are only a risk to the animals they bite. The purpose of this study is to identify and assess spatial patterns of host-use in a temperate urban landscape with heterogeneous socio-economic and ecological conditions. Results: Mosquito blood meals were collected from neighborhoods categorized along a socio-economic gradient in Baltimore, MD, USA. Blood meal hosts were identified for two Aedes (Ae. albopictus and Ae. japonicus) and three Culex (Cx. pipiens, Cx. restuans and Cx. salinarius) species. The brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) was the most frequently detected host in both Aedes species and Cx. salinarius. Human biting was evident in Aedes and Culex species and the proportion of human blood meals from Ae. albopictus varied significantly with neighborhood socio-economic status. Aedes albopictus was most likely to feed on human blood hosts (at 50%) in residential blocks categorized as having income above the city median, although there were still more total human bites detected from lower income blocks where Ae. albopictus was more abundant. Birds were the most frequently detected Culex blood hosts but were absent from all Aedes sampled. Conclusions: This study highlights fine-scale variation in host-use by medically important mosquito vectors and specifically investigates blood meal composition at spatial scales relevant to urban mosquito dispersal and human exposure. Further, the work emphasizes the importance of neighborhood economics and infrastructure management in shaping both the relative abundance of vectors and local blood feeding strategies. The invasive brown rat was an important blood source across vector species and neighborhoods in Baltimore. We show that social and economic conditions can be important predictors of transmission potential in urban landscapes and identify important questions about the role of rodents in supporting urban mosquito populations. ¬© 2018 The Author(s).","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85045191377&doi=10.1186%2fs13071-018-2779-7&partnerID=40&md5=b6337217bbf31f222814b2bb17661494","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/pubmed.csv",2

Most infections now originate from the national border regions. In these areas, the prevalence of asymptomatic infections is still substantial and poses a challenge for the national malaria elimination program. To determine epidemiological parameters as well as risk factors for malaria infection in western Thailand, we carried out a cohort study in Kanchanaburi and Ratchaburi provinces on the Thailand-Myanmar border. Blood samples from 999 local participants were examined for malaria infection every 4 weeks between May 2013 and Jun 2014. Prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax was determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and showed a seasonal variation with values fluctuating from 1.7% to 4.2% for P. vivax and 0% to 1.3% for P. falciparum. Ninety percent of infections were asymptomatic. The annual molecular force of blood-stage infection (molFOB) was estimated by microsatellite genotyping to be 0.24 new infections per person-year for P. vivax and 0.02 new infections per person-year for P. falciparum. The distribution of infections was heterogenous, that is, the vast majority of infections (&gt;80%) were found in a small number of individuals (&lt;8% of the study population) who tested positive at multiple timepoints. Significant risk factors were detected for P. vivax infections, including previous clinical malaria, occupation in agriculture and travel to Myanmar. In contrast, indoor residual spraying was associated with a protection from infection. These findings provide a recent landscape of malaria epidemiology and emphasize the importance of novel strategies to target asymptomatic and imported infections. ¬© 2019","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85063964574&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijpara.2019.01.004&partnerID=40&md5=a890bc5d715148c66d189c7bdf2337c9","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/pubmed.csv",2

Over the past 10,000 years, humans have successfully cultivated grasses and altered the landscape, creating An. arabiensis favourable environments that contain excellent habitats for both larvae and adults. Sugarcane is the most expanding agricultural system in sub-Saharan Africa, and is linked to the increased threat of malaria in rural communities. The prolific production and wind dispersal of sugarcane pollen, together with standing pools of water, often provide, as a result of irrigation, a nutrient-rich environment for the offspring of gravid malaria mosquitoes. Results: In the present study, sugarcane pollen-associated volatiles from two cultivars are shown to attract gravid An. arabiensis in a still air two-port olfactometer and stimulate egg laying in an oviposition bioassay. Through combined gas chromatography and electroantennographic detection, as well as combined gas chromatography and mass spectrometric analyses, we identified the bioactive volatiles and generated a synthetic blend that reproduced the full behavioural repertoire of gravid mosquitoes in the Y-tube assay. Two subtractive odour blends, when compared with the full blend, were significantly more attractive. These three and four-component subtractive blends share the compounds (1R)-(+)-Œ±-pinene, nonanal and benzaldehyde, of which, (1R)-(+)-Œ±-pinene and nonanal are found in the attractive odour blends from rice plants and maize pollen. In pairwise comparisons, the rice synthetic odour blend was more attractive to gravid mosquitoes than either of the pollen blends, whereas the pollen blends did not differ in attraction. Conclusions: The attraction of gravid females to sugarcane pollen volatiles demonstrated in this study, together with the previously found grass-associated volatiles, raise the potential of developing a bioactive chimeric blend to attract gravid malaria mosquitoes. This is discussed in relation to the development of novel and cost-effective vector control measures. ¬© 2018 The Author(s).","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85042365111&doi=10.1186%2fs12936-018-2245-1&partnerID=40&md5=7af065487004a422f7f5cef447aa17f8","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/pubmed.csv",2

Community-level changes after anthropogenic land-use change have been studied in a variety of organisms, but the effects on arthropods of medical and veterinary importance remain poorly characterized. Shifts in diversity, abundance, and community composition of such arthropods, like mosquitoes, can significantly impact vector-borne disease dynamics due to varying vectorial capacity between different species. In light of these potential implications for vector-borne diseases, we investigated changes in mosquito species assemblage after suburbanization by sampling mosquitoes in neighborhoods of different ages in Wake County, North Carolina, US. We found that independent of housing density and socioeconomic status, mosquito diversity measures decreased as suburban neighborhoods aged. In the oldest neighborhoods, the mosquito assemblage reached a distinct suburban climax community dominated by the invasive, peridomestic container-breeding Aedes albopictus, the Asian tiger mosquito. Aedes albopictus is a competent vector of many pathogens of human concern, and its dominance in suburban areas places it in close proximity with humans, allowing for heightened potential of host-vector interactions. While further research is necessary to explicitly characterize the effects of mosquito community simplification on vector-borne disease transmission in highly suburbanized areas, the current study demonstrates that suburbanization is disrupting mosquito communities so severely that they do not recover their diversity even 100 years after the initial disturbance. Our understanding of the community-level effects of anthropogenic land-use change on arthropod vectors will become increasingly important as we look to mitigate disease spread in a global landscape that is continually developed and altered by humans. ¬© 2019 Spence Beaulieu et al.

It is transmitted by mosquitoes, and the main strategy for epidemic prevention and control is insecticide fumigation. Effective management is, however, proving elusive. People‚Äôs day-to-day movement about the city is believed to be an important factor in the epidemiological dynamics. We use a simple model to examine the fundamental roles of broad demographic and spatial structures in epidemic initiation, growth and control. We show that the key factors are local dilution, characterised by the vector‚Äìhost ratio, and spatial connectivity, characterised by the extent of habitually variable movement patterns. Epidemic risk in the population is driven by the demographic groups that frequent the areas with the highest vector‚Äìhost ratio, even if they only spend some of their time there. Synchronisation of epidemic trajectories in different demographic groups is governed by the vector‚Äìhost ratios to which they are exposed and the strength of connectivity. Strategies for epidemic prevention and management may be made more effective if they take into account the fluctuating landscape of transmission intensity associated with spatial heterogeneity in the vector‚Äìhost ratio and people‚Äôs day-to-day movement patterns. ¬© 2016, The Author(s).","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84990849598&doi=10.1007%2fs11538-016-0209-6&partnerID=40&md5=abb09f0f143ffdde39cbf1d96dd9ac62","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/pubmed.csv",2

In endemic areas, behavioral aspects of anopheline vectors such as host preference, biting time and resting location post blood meal have a key impact on malaria transmission dynamics and vector control interventions. Nyssorhynchus darlingi presents a range of feeding and resting behaviors throughout its broad distribution. Methods: To investigate the genetic diversity related to biting behavior, we collected host-seeking Ny. darlingi in two settlement types in Acre, Brazil: Granada (~ 20-year-old, more established, better access by road, few malaria cases) and Remansinho (~ 8-year-old, active logging, poor road access, high numbers malaria cases). Mosquitoes were classified by the location of collection (indoors or outdoors) and time (dusk or dawn). Results: Genome-wide SNPs, used to assess the degree of genetic divergence and population structure, identified non-random distributions of individuals in the PCA for both location and time analyses. Although genetic diversity related to behavior was confirmed by non-model-based analyses and F ST values, model-based STRUCTURE detected considerable admixture of these populations. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study to detect genetic markers associated with biting behavior in Ny. darlingi. Additional ecological and genomic studies may help to understand the genetic basis of mosquito behavior and address appropriate surveillance and vector control. ¬© 2019 The Author(s).","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065895778&doi=10.1186%2fs13071-019-3498-4&partnerID=40&md5=6338bf9b846af7303d83f73e31be3b4e","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/pubmed.csv",2

This challenge is growing as the invasive mosquito vectors, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, expand their distributions and increase their population sizes. Hence there is an increasing need to devise effective control methods that can contain dengue outbreaks. Here we construct an epidemiological model for virus transmission between vectors and hosts on a network of host populations distributed among city and town patches, and investigate disease control through vaccination and vector control using variants of the sterile insect technique (SIT). Analysis of the basic reproductive number and simulations indicate that host movement across this small network influences the severity of epidemics. Both vaccination and vector control strategies are investigated as methods of disease containment and our results indicate that these controls can be made more effective with mixed strategy solutions. We predict that reduced lethality through poor SIT methods or imperfectly efficacious vaccines will impact efforts to control disease spread. In particular, weakly efficacious vaccination strategies against multiple virus serotype diversity may be counter productive to disease control efforts. Even so, failings of one method may be mitigated by supplementing it with an alternative control strategy. Generally, our network approach encourages decision making to consider connected populations, to emphasise that successful control methods must effectively suppress dengue epidemics at this landscape scale. ¬© 2016 The Authors","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84982747299&doi=10.1016%2fj.jtbi.2016.07.034&partnerID=40&md5=bd78926ce872e08438a23f72d3c50462","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/pubmed.csv",2

Among the flaviviral proteins, the nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) is the largest, most conserved, and major enzymatic component of the viral replication complex. Disruption of the common key NS5-host protein-protein interactions critical for viral replication could aid in the development of broad-spectrum antiflaviviral therapeutics. Hundreds of NS5 interactors have been identified, but these are mostly DENV-NS5 interactors. To this end, we sought to investigate the JEV- and ZIKV-NS5 interactomes using EGFP immunoprecipitation with label-free quantitative mass spectrometry analysis. We report here a total of 137 NS5 interactors with a significant enrichment of spliceosomal and spliceosomal-associated proteins. The transcription complex Paf1C and phosphatase 6 were identified as common NS5-associated complexes. PAF1 was shown to play opposite roles in JEV and ZIKV infections. Additionally, we validated several NS5 targets and proposed their possible roles in infection. These include lipid-shuttling proteins OSBPL9 and OSBPL11, component of RNAP3 transcription factor TFIIIC, minichromosome maintenance, and cochaperone PAQosome.

The ecological and environmental conditions (including those created by humans through vector control programmes) that result in metapopulation dynamics remain poorly understood. The development of control strategies that would most effectively limit outbreaks given such dynamics is particularly urgent given the recent epidemics of dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses. We developed a stochastic, spatial model of vectorborne disease transmission, allowing for movement of hosts between patches. Our model is applicable to arbovirus transmission by Aedes aegypti in urban settings and was parametrized to capture Zika virus transmission in particular. Using simulations, we investigated the extent to which two aspects of vector control strategies are affected by human commuting patterns: the extent of coordination and cooperation between neighbouring communities. We find that transmission intensity is highest at intermediate levels of host movement. The extent to which coordination of control activities among neighbouring patches decreases the prevalence of infection is affected by both how frequently humans commute and the proportion of neighbouring patches that commits to vector surveillance and control activities. At high levels of host movement, patches that do not contribute to vector control may act as sources of infection in the landscape, yet have comparable levels of prevalence as patches that do cooperate. This result suggests that real cooperation among neighbours will be critical to the development of effective pro-active strategies for vector-borne disease control in today's commuter-linked communities. ¬© 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Forest disturbance significantly affected the abundance of LACV accessory vectors, with a higher abundance on disturbed sites for Ae. canadensis and Ae. vexans. However, there was no significant disturbance effect on chipmunk abundance. Forest disturbance significantly affected LACV prevalence in mosquito vectors, with most (80%) detections on unlogged control sites, which past work showed harbor the highest abundance of the two most common LACV vectors (the primary vector Aedes triseriatus, and Ae. japonicus). Interestingly, LACV nucleic acid was only detected in Ae. japonicus and Culex pipiens/restuans, with no detections in the primary vector, Ae. triseriatus. In contrast to the vector results, antibodies were only found in chipmunks on logged sites, but this result was not statistically significant. Overall, our results suggest that human LACV risk should generally decline with logging, and reveal the potential importance of accessory vectors in LACV maintenance in Appalachian forests. ¬© 2019 by the authors.

This study was conducted to assess the movement pattern of exophilic Anopheles mosquitoes between blood meal sources and resting habitats, and the landscape factors dictating their resting habitat choice. Results: Resting clay pots were placed at 5 m, 25 m, 50 m, 75 m and 100 m away from isolated focal houses, radiating from them in four directions. The locations of the clay pots represent heterogeneous land cover types at a relatively fine spatial scale in the landscape. The effect of the landscape characters on the number of both female and male anophelines caught was modelled using zero-inflated negative binomial regression with a log link function. A total of 420 Anopheles mosquitoes (353 females and 67 males) belonging to three species; Anopheles arabiensis, Anopheles pharoensis, and Anopheles tenebrosus were caught in the resting clay pots, with An. arabiensis being the dominant species. Canopy cover, distance from the house, and land cover type were the significant landscape characters influencing the aggregation of resting mosquitoes. Both the count and binary models showed that canopy cover was the strongest predictor variable on the counts and the presence of Anopheles mosquitoes in the clay pots. Female Anopheles were most frequently found resting in the pots placed in banana plantations, and at sampling points that were at the greater distances (75 m and 100 m) from the focal house. Conclusions: This study showed that exophilic Anopheles mosquitoes tend to rest in shaded areas some distance away from human habitation.

Traps were distributed over an area of 54,984 ha divided into six ecological units: marshland, sand dunes, scrubland, ricefields, crops and fishponds. We collected mosquitoes once a month fromup to 112 locations using BG-Sentinel traps baited with BG-lure and CO2 during March-November 2010. Hydroperiod, NDVI and Inundation surface were estimated at several resolution scales (100, 250, 500, 1000 and 2000 metres) from corrected and normalized Landsat Images.We sampled 972,346 female mosquitoes, the most abundant species being Culex theileri, Ochlerotatus caspius, Culex modestus, Culex perexiguus, Culex pipiens, Anopheles atroparvus and Ochlerotatus detritus. Our results suggest that: (1) hydroperiod, inundation surface and NDVI are strongly related to the spatial distribution ofmosquitoes; (2) the spatial scales used tomeasure these variables affected quantification of these relationships, the larger scale being more informative; (3) these relationships are species-specific; (4) hydroperiod is negatively related to mosquito presence and richness; (5) Culex abundance is positively related to hydroperiod; (6) NDVI is positively related to mosquito diversity, presence and abundance, except in the case of the two saltmarsh species (Oc. caspius and Oc. detritus); and (7) inundation surfaces positively condition the abundance and richness of most species except the salt marsh mosquitoes. Remote sensing data provided reliable information formonitoringmosquito populations. Landscape significantly affected mosquito distribution and abundance, and as a result may alter disease risk.

We hypothesized that parasite prevalence will be more affected by vector-related parameters, while host parameters should be also important to explain Plasmodium richness and evenness. We sampled 2,588 wild house sparrows (Passer domesticus) and 340,829 mosquitoes, and we performed vertebrate censuses at 45 localities in the Southwest of Spain. These localities included urban, rural and natural landscapes that were characterized by several habitat variables. Twelve Plasmodium lineages were identified in house sparrows corresponding to three major clades. Variation partitioning showed that landscape characteristics explained the highest fraction of variation in all response variables (21.0%‚Äì44.8%). Plasmodium prevalence was in addition explained by vector-related variables (5.4%) and its interaction with landscape (10.2%). Parasite richness and evenness were mostly explained by vertebrate community-related variables. The structuring role of landscape characteristics in vector and host communities was a key factor in determining parasite prevalence, richness and evenness, although the role of each factor differed according to the parasite parameters studied.

Recent reports indicate that the levels of malaria-associated mortality and morbidity in SSA have remained the same. Malaria vectors have modified their feeding behavior in response to the selective pressure from indoor-based interventions, and there is emerging malaria parasite resistance to artemisinin-based combination therapies. These challenges have created an altered malaria landscape, especially within local scales in some malaria-endemic countries in SSA. To address these challenges, complementary new strategies are urgently required for malaria control. This paper argues that to develop the next generation of vector and chemotherapeutic tools for malaria control, especially based on natural products with novel modes of action, a better understanding of mosquito bioecology and, more importantly, plant sugar feeding is needed. ¬© 2019 Society of Chemical Industry. ¬© 2019 Society of Chemical Industry","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85066821603&doi=10.1002%2fps.5460&partnerID=40&md5=8730f78f76a662fbd6992ee9dd360dda","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/pubmed.csv",2

This species is usually abundant in the forests where it occurs, preferring to live and feed on canopies, behaviour known as acrodendrophily. However, in several studies and locations this species has been observed in high density near the ground in the forest. In this study, it was hypothesized that factors associated with anthropogenic landscape changes may be responsible for the variation in abundance and acrodendrophily observed in An. cruzii. Methods: The study was conducted in a conservation unit in the city of S√£o Paulo, Brazil. Monthly entomological collections were performed from March 2015 to April 2017, and the resulting data were used with data from another study conducted in the same area between May 2009 and June 2010. Mosquitoes were collected from five sites using CDC and Shannon traps. Landscape composition and configuration metrics were measured, and generalized linear mixed-effect models were used to investigate the relationship between these metrics and variations in the abundance and acrodendrophily of An. cruzii. Results: The model that showed the best fit for the relationship between landscape metrics and An. cruzii abundance suggests that an increase in the proportion of forest cover leads to an increase in the abundance of this mosquito, while the model that best explained variations in An. cruzii acrodendrophily suggests that an increase in total forest-edge length leads to greater activity by this species at ground level. Conclusion: While the data indicate that changes in landscape due to human activities lead to a reduction in An. cruzii abundance, such changes may increase the contact rate between this species and humans living on the edges of forest fragments where An. cruzii is found. Future studies should, therefore, seek to elucidate the effect of these landscape changes on the dynamics of Plasmodium transmission in the Atlantic Forest, which according to some studies includes the participation of simian hosts. ¬© 2019 The Author(s).","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85063805503&doi=10.1186%2fs12936-019-2744-8&partnerID=40&md5=36070d7c0c1db5c3f9ede2032fc89771","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/pubmed.csv",2

The identification of two novel tick-borne phleboviruses (TBPVs), severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) and Heartland virus (HRTV), as causative agents of severe illness in humans has accelerated the investigation and discoveries of novel TBPVs. In the present study, we isolated a novel TBPV designated Mukawa virus (MKWV) from host-questing Ixodes persulcatus females captured in Japan. Genetic characterization revealed that MKWV is a member of the genus Phlebovirus in the family Phenuiviridae. Interestingly, MKWV is genetically distinct from other known TBPVs and shares a most recent common ancestor with mosquito/sandflyborne (insect-borne) phleboviruses. Despite its genetic similarity to insect-borne phleboviruses, the molecular footprints of its viral proteins and its biological characteristics define MKWV as a tick-borne virus that can be transmitted to mammals. A phylogenetic ancestral-state reconstruction for arthropod vectors of phleboviruses including MKWV based on viral L segment sequences indicated that ticks likely harbored ancestral phleboviruses that evolved into both the tick-borne and MKWV/ insect-borne phlebovirus lineages. Overall, our findings suggest that most of the phlebovirus evolution has occurred in hard ticks to generate divergent viruses, which may provide a seminal foundation for understanding the mechanisms underlying the evolution and emergence of pathogenic phleboviruses, such as Rift Valley fever virus and SFTSV/HRTV. IMPORTANCE The emergence of novel tick-borne RNA viruses causing severe illness in humans has complicated the epidemiological landscape of tick-borne diseases, requiring further investigation to safeguard public health. In the present study, we discovered a novel tick-borne phlebovirus from Ixodes persulcatus ticks in Japan. While its viral RNA genome sequences were similar to those of mosquito/sandfly-borne viruses, molecular and biological footprints confirmed that this is a tick-borne virus. The unique evolutionary position of the virus allowed us to estimate the ancestral phlebovirus vector, which was likely a hard tick. Our findings may provide a better understanding of the evolution and emergence of phleboviruses associated with emerging infectious diseases, such as severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) and Heartland virus disease. ¬© 2018 Matsuno et al.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055169085&doi=10.1128%2fMSPHERE.00239-18&partnerID=40&md5=cc6313d9cbf16024b0abf1510345a0ee","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/pubmed.csv",2

This has been well explored for ticks, but not for mosquitoes, despite their importance in the transmission of a variety of pathogens. This study examined the importance of habitat, habitat edges, and the scale at which mosquito abundance and diversity vary in a rural landscape by trapping along transects from grassland areas into forest patches. Significant patterns of vector diversity and distinct mosquito assemblages across habitats were found. The scale of individual species' responses to habitat edges was often dramatic, with several species rarely straying even 10 m from the edge. The present results suggest blood-seeking mosquito species are faithful to certain habitats, which has consequences for patterns of vector diversity and risk for pathogen transmission. This implies that analysts of risk for pathogen transmission and foci of control, and developers of land management strategies should assess habitat at a finer scale than previously considered. ¬© 2016 The Royal Entomological Society","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84991665517&doi=10.1111%2fmve.12193&partnerID=40&md5=21a93758e84fd952df15bc758ba1106a","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/pubmed.csv",2

Predicting how environmental changes will impact VBD transmission is dependent on understanding the ecology and behaviour of potential vector species outside of domestic settings. However there are few reliable sampling tools for measuring the habitat preference and host choice of mosquito vectors; with almost none suitable for sampling recently blood-fed, resting mosquitoes. This study evaluated the use of two mosquito traps: the resting bucket (RB) and sticky resting bucket (SRB) traps relative to CDC backpack aspiration (CDC) for sampling mosquitoes resting in a range of habitats representing a gradient of deforestation. Eight habitats were selected for sampling around two villages in Kudat District, Malaysian Borneo, to reflect the range of habitats available to mosquitoes in and around human dwellings, and nearby forest habitats where reservoir hosts are present: secondary forest (edge, interior and canopy); plantations (palm and rubber); and human settlements (inside, under and around houses). Results: Over 31 days, 2243 mosquitoes were collected in 5748 discrete collections. Nine mosquito genera were sampled with Aedes and Culex species being present in all habitats and most abundant. RB and CDC backpack aspiration were most efficient for sampling Culex whereas CDC backpack aspiration and SRB were most efficient for Aedes. Most Aedes identified to species level were Ae. albopictus (91%), with their abundance being highest in forest edge habitats. In contrast, Culex were most abundant under houses. Most blood-fed mosquitoes (76%) were found in human settlements; with humans and chickens being the only blood source. Conclusions: RB and SRB traps proved capable of sampling mosquitoes resting in all sampled habitats. However, sampling efficiency was generally low (c.0.1 per trap per day), necessitating traps to be deployed in high numbers for mosquito detection. None of the traps were effective for sampling zoonotic malaria vectors; however, SRB collected relatively higher numbers of the dengue vector Ae. albopictus. The higher abundance of mosquitoes in forest edge habitats indicates the potential value of these traps for investigating sylvatic dengue transmission. This study has demonstrated the merits in application of simple resting traps for characterising mosquito vector resting behaviour outside of the home. ¬© 2018 The Author(s).","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85048626013&doi=10.1186%2fs13071-018-2926-1&partnerID=40&md5=f4920e6e0d343109fe9e0841636a7c7f","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/pubmed.csv",2

Particularly important in urban regions, where these species have evolved to breed in man-made containers and feed nearly exclusively on human hosts, the threat of vector-borne disease has risen in recent decades due to the growth of cities, progression of climate change, and increase in globalization. While the dynamics of Aedes populations in urban settings have been well studied in relation to ecological features of the landscape, relatively less is known about the relationship between neighborhood socioeconomic status and Aedes infestation. Here, we compare infestation levels of both A. aegypti and A. albopictus in four socioeconomically contrasting neighborhoods of urban Panama City, Panama. Our results indicate that infestation levels for both Aedes species vary between neighborhoods of contrasting socioeconomic status, being higher in neighborhoods having lower percentage of residents with bachelor degrees and lower monthly household income. Additionally, we find that proximity between socioeconomically contrasting neighborhoods can predict infestation levels by species, with A. aegypti increasing and A. albopictus decreasing with proximity between neighborhoods.

In particular, malaria in the Amazon region is often cited as an example of how forest conservation can improve public health outcomes. However, despite a growing body of literature and an increased understanding of the relationship between malaria and land use / land cover change (LULC) in Amazonia, contradictions have emerged. While some studies report that deforestation increases malaria risk, others claim the opposite. Assessing malaria risk requires examination of dynamic processes among three main components: (i) the environment (i.e. LULC and landscape transformations), (ii) vector biology (e.g. mosquito species distributions, vector activity and life cycle, plasmodium infection rates), and (iii) human populations (e.g. forest-related activity, host susceptibility, movement patterns).

This leaves public health agencies with an incomplete understanding of the spectrum of infection risk across the diverse geography of the Australian continent. The current investigation sought to assess the risk of RRV epidemics based on abiotic and biotic landscape features in anthropogenic landscapes, with a particular focus on the influence of water and wildlife hosts. Methods: Abiotic features, including hydrology, land cover and altitude, and biotic features, including the distribution of wild mammalian hosts, were interrogated using a Maxent model to discern the landscape suitability to RRV epidemics in anthropogenically impacted environments across Australia. Results: Water-soil balance, proximity to controlled water reservoirs, and the ecological niches of four species (Perameles nasuta, Wallabia bicolor, Pseudomys novaehollandiae and Trichosurus vulpecula) were important features identifying high risk landscapes suitable for the occurrence of RRV epidemics. Conclusions: These results help to delineate human infection risk and thus provide an important perspective for geographically targeted vector, wildlife, and syndromic surveillance within and across the boundaries of local health authorities. Importantly, our analysis highlights the importance of the hydrology, and the potential role of mammalian host species in shaping RRV epidemic risk in peri-urban space. This study offers novel insight into wildlife hosts and RRV infection ecology and identifies those species that may be beneficial to future targeted field surveillance particularly in ecosystems undergoing rapid change. ¬© 2018 The Author(s).","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85044193700&doi=10.1186%2fs13071-018-2776-x&partnerID=40&md5=b4a6c96ac60b588a09bd399c5d5098ea","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/pubmed.csv",2

Among arthropods, mosquito midgut microbiota has been largely investigated, providing crucial insights on the role and implications of host-symbiont relationships. However, limited amount of studies addressed their efforts on the investigation of microbiota colonizing salivary glands and reproductive tracts, crucial organs for pathogen invasion and vertical transmission of symbiotic microorganisms. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing-based approach, we analysed the microbiota of gut, salivary glands and reproductive tracts of several mosquito species, representing some of the main vectors of diseases, aiming at describing the dynamics of bacterial communities within the individual. Results: We identified a shared core microbiota between different mosquito species, although interesting inter- and intra-species differences were detected. Additionally, our results showed deep divergences between genera, underlining microbiota specificity and adaptation to their host. Conclusions: The comprehensive landscape of the bacterial microbiota components may ultimately provide crucial insights and novel targets for possible application of symbionts in innovative strategies for the control of vector borne diseases, globally named Symbiotic Control (SC), and suggesting that the holobiont of different mosquito species may significantly vary. Moreover, mosquito species are characterized by distinctive microbiota in different organs, likely reflecting different functions and/or adaptation processes. ¬© 2018 The Author(s).","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054423472&doi=10.1186%2fs12866-018-1266-9&partnerID=40&md5=c148df1410f51e493282e61378045d12","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/pubmed.csv",2

However, the ever growing human population in the highlands of Africa has led to the deforestation and land coverage changes to create space for more land for cultivation, grazing, and house construction materials needs. This has lead to the creation of suitable breeding habitats, which are in open places. Decrease of canopy and forest cover has led to increased temperature both in outdoors and indoors in deforested areas. This increased temperature has resulted in the shortening of developmental stages of aquatic stages of mosquitoes and sporogony development in adult mosquitoes. Method: Assessment of the effects of deforestation and land coverage changes (decrease), which leads to temperature changes and subsequently increases survivorship of adults and sporogony development in adult mosquitoes' body was gathered from previous data collected from 2003 to 2012 using different analysis techniques. Habitats productivity, species dynamics and abundance, mosquitoes feeding rates, and sporogony development are presented in relation to temperature changes. Results: The effects of temperature rise due to land cover changes in highlands of western Kenya on larval developmental rates, adult sporogony developments, and malaria risk in human population were derived. Vector species dynamics and abundance in relation to land use changes have been found to change with time. Conclusion: This study found that, land cover changes is a key driver for the temperature rise in African highlands and increases the rate of malaria vectors Anopheles gambiae ssp., An. Funestus, and An. arabiensis colonizing the highlands. It has also significantly enhanced sporogony development rate and adult vector survival and therefore the risk of malaria transmission in the highlands. ¬© 2016 Kweka, Kimaro and Munga.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85015394138&doi=10.3389%2fFPUBH.2016.00238&partnerID=40&md5=9ee6c4338508683662e599e46876bc10","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/pubmed.csv",2

Temperate regions are generally expected to pose low risk for significant mosquito-borne disease; however, the spread of the Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) across densely populated urban areas has established a new landscape of risk. We use a model informed by field data to assess the conditions likely to facilitate local transmission of chikungunya and Zika viruses from an infected traveler to Ae. albopictus and then to other humans in USA cities with variable human densities and seasonality. Mosquito-borne disease occurs when specific combinations of conditions maximize virus-to-mosquito and mosquito-to-human contact rates. We develop a mathematical model that captures the epidemiology and is informed by current data on vector ecology from urban sites. The model demonstrates that under specific but realistic conditions, fifty-percent of introductions by infectious travelers to a high human, high mosquito density city could initiate local transmission and 10% of the introductions could result in 100 or more people infected. Despite the propensity for Ae. albopictus to bite non-human vertebrates, we also demonstrate that local virus transmission and human outbreaks may occur when vectors feed from humans even just 40% of the time. Inclusion of human behavioral changes and mitigations were not incorporated into the models and would likely reduce predicted infections. This work demonstrates how a conditional series of non-average events can result in local arbovirus transmission and outbreaks of human disease, even in temperate cities. ¬© 2017 Manore et al.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85012900680&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pntd.0005255&partnerID=40&md5=0099d11a6e1d467076038f20b6069e79","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/pubmed.csv",2

Coupled human and natural systems (CHANS) research uses a multidisciplinary approach to identify the key actors, processes, and feedbacks that drive metapopulation and landscape dynamics. We describe a framework for modeling metapopulations in CHANS that integrates ecological and social data by coupling stochastic patch occupancy models of metapopulation dynamics with agent-based models of land-use change. We then apply this framework to metapopulations of the threatened black rail (Laterallus jamaicensis) and widespread Virginia rail (Rallus limicola) that inhabit patchy, irrigation-fed wetlands in the rangelands of the California Sierra Nevada foothills. We collected data from five diverse sources (rail occupancy surveys, land-use change mapping, a survey of landowner decision making, climate and reservoir databases, and mosquito trapping and West Nile virus testing) and integrated them into an agent-based stochastic patch occupancy model. We used the model to (1) quantify the drivers of metapopulation dynamics, and the potential interactions and feedbacks among them; (2) test predictions of the behavior of metapopulations in dynamic working landscapes; and (3) evaluate the impact of three policy options on metapopulation persistence (irrigation district water cutbacks during drought, incentives for landowners to create wetlands, and incentives for landowners to protect wetlands). Complex metapopulation dynamics emerged when landscapes functioned as CHANS, highlighting the importance of integrating human activities and other ecological processes into metapopulation models. Rail metapopulations were strongly top-down regulated by precipitation, and the black rail's decade-long decline was caused by the combination of West Nile virus and drought. Theoretical predictions of the two metapopulations‚Äô responses to dynamic landscapes and incentive programs were complicated by heterogeneity in patch quality and CHANS couplings, respectively. Irrigation cutbacks during drought posed a serious extinction risk that neither incentive policy effectively ameliorated. ¬© 2019 by the Ecological Society of America","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065202487&doi=10.1002%2fecy.2711&partnerID=40&md5=4724225146f356a84d2b595c90a86188","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/pubmed.csv",2

This is particularly apparent for mosquitoes, which use a combination of olfactory, visual, and thermal cues to locate hosts [6-10]. Mosquitoes are thought to detect suitable hosts by the presence of a sparse CO<inf>2</inf> plume, which they track by surging upwind and casting crosswind [11]. Upon approach, local cues such as heat and skin volatiles help them identify a landing site [12-15]. Recent evidence suggests that thermal attraction is gated by the presence of CO<inf>2</inf> [6], although this conclusion was based experiments in which the actual flight trajectories of the animals were unknown and visual cues were not studied. Using a three-dimensional tracking system, we show that rather than gating heat sensing, the detection of CO<inf>2</inf> actually activates a strong attraction to visual features. This visual reflex guides the mosquitoes to potential hosts where they are close enough to detect thermal cues. By experimentally decoupling the olfactory, visual, and thermal cues, we show that the motor reactions to these stimuli are independently controlled. Given that humans become visible to mosquitoes at a distance of 5-15 m [16], visual cues play a critical intermediate role in host localization by coupling long-range plume tracking to behaviors that require short-range cues. Rather than direct neural coupling, the separate sensory-motor reflexes are linked as a result of the interaction between the animal's reactions and the spatial structure of the stimuli in the environment. ¬© 2015 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84939569432&doi=10.1016%2fj.cub.2015.06.046&partnerID=40&md5=8f47a6daa2d6d5ecbc6e3605639f64dc","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/pubmed.csv",2

Recent introductions in Cairns, Australia have demonstrated slower than expected spatial spread. Potential reasons for this include: (i) barriers to Ae. aegypti dispersal; (ii) higher incidence of long-range dispersal; and (iii) intergenerational loss of Wolbachia. We investigated these three potential factors using genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and an assay for the Wolbachia infection wMel in 161 Ae. aegypti collected from Cairns in 2015. We detected a small but significant barrier effect of Cairns highways on Ae. aegypti dispersal using distance-based redundancy analysis and patch-based simulation analysis. We detected a pair of putative full-siblings in ovitraps 1312 m apart, indicating long-distance female movement likely mediated by human transport. We also found a pair of full-siblings of different infection status, indicating intergenerational loss of Wolbachia in the field. These three factors are all expected to contribute to the slow spread of Wolbachia through Ae. aegypti populations, though from our results it is unclear whether Wolbachia loss and long-distance movement are sufficiently common to reduce the speed of spatial spread appreciably. Our findings inform the strategic deployment of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes during releases, and show how parameter estimates from laboratory studies may differ from those estimated using field data.

We collected Ny. darlingi, Nyssorhynchus rangeli (formerly Anopheles rangeli), Nyssorhynchus triannulatus s.l. (formerly Anopheles triannulatus s.l.), and Nyssorhynchus sp. nr. konderi (formerly Anopheles sp. nr. konderi) from natural and artificial water bodies throughout the rainy and dry seasons. We found that, consistent with previous studies in this region and in Brazil, the presence of Ny. darlingi was significantly associated with water bodies in landscapes with more recent deforestation and lower light intensity. Nyssorhynchus darlingi presence was also significantly associated with a lower vegetation index, other Anophelinae species, and emergent vegetation. Though they were collected in the same water bodies, the microbial communities of Ny. darlingi larvae were distinct from those of Ny. rangeli and Ny. triannulatus s.l., providing evidence either for a species-specific larval microbiome or for segregation of these species in distinct microhabitats within each water body. We demonstrated that houses with more reported malaria cases were located closer to Ny. darlingi larval habitats; thus, targeted control of these sites could help ameliorate malaria risk. The co-occurrence of Ny. darlingi larvae in water bodies with other putative malaria vectors increases the potential impact of larval source management in this region. ¬© 2019 Prussing et al.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067268754&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pntd.0007412&partnerID=40&md5=4f6b77236995c43e0bae5d88d99d7208","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/pubmed.csv",2

For this reason, species composition and dynamics were examined in 2016 in two zoological gardens in Germany. Using different methods for mosquito sampling, a total of 2,257 specimens belonging to 20 taxa were collected. Species spectra depended on the collection method but generally differed between the two zoos, while species compositions and relative abundances varied seasonally in both of them. As both sampled zoos were located in the same climatic region and potential breeding sites within the zoos were similar, the differences in mosquito compositions are attributed to immigration of specimens from surrounding landscapes, although the different sizes of the zoos and the different blood host populations available probably also have an impact. Based on the differences in species composition and the various biological characteristics of the species, the risk of certain pathogens to be transmitted must also be expected to differ between the zoos. ¬© 2018 The Society for Vector Ecology","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047471764&doi=10.1111%2fjvec.12286&partnerID=40&md5=398953d105da6abc8f7b30b7ead6058b","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/pubmed.csv",2

As a result, implementing sustainable infectious disease surveillance systems in these regions is challenging. The cost of these programs and difficulties associated with collecting, storing and transporting relevant samples have hindered them in the regions where they are most needed. Therefore, we tested the sensitivity and feasibility of a novel surveillance technique called xenosurveillance. This approach utilizes the host feeding preferences and behaviors of Anopheles gambiae, which are highly anthropophilic and rest indoors after feeding, to sample viruses in human beings. We hypothesized that mosquito bloodmeals could be used to detect vertebrate viral pathogens within realistic field collection timeframes and clinically relevant concentrations. To validate this approach, we examined variables influencing virus detection such as the duration between mosquito blood feeding and mosquito processing, the pathogen nucleic acid stability in the mosquito gut and the pathogen load present in the host‚Äôs blood at the time of bloodmeal ingestion using our laboratory model. Our findings revealed that viral nucleic acids, at clinically relevant concentrations, could be detected from engorged mosquitoes for up to 24 hours post feeding by qRT-PCR. Subsequently, we tested this approach in the field by examining blood from engorged mosquitoes from two field sites in Liberia. Using next-generation sequencing and PCR we were able to detect the genetic signatures of multiple viral pathogens including Epstein-Barr virus and canine distemper virus.Together, these data demonstrate the feasibility of xenosurveillance and in doing so validated a simple and non-invasive surveillance tool that could be used to complement current biosurveillance efforts.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84928816978&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pntd.0003628&partnerID=40&md5=3e5d66b16ad3350cbb50ab4026841f93","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/pubmed.csv",2

Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) spread by Aedes mosquitoes are (re)emerging in many parts of the tropics, partially explained by changes in agricultural land-use. We explored the effects of land-use changes on the abundance, distribution, and host-seeking behavior of Aedes mosquitoes along a gradient of anthropogenic disturbance in oil palm-dominated landscapes in southeastern C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire. Methodology: Between January and December 2014, eggs, larvae, pupae, and adults of Aedes mosquitoes were sampled in four types of macrohabitats (rainforest, polyculture, oil palm monoculture, and rural housing areas), using standard procedures (bamboo-ovitraps, metallic-ovitraps, larval surveys, and human-baited double-net traps). Immature stages were reared and adult mosquitoes identified at species level. Principal findings: A total of 28,276 Aedes specimens belonging to 11 species were collected. No Aedes-positive microhabitat and only four specimens of Ae. aegypti were found in oil palm monoculture. The highest abundance of Aedes mosquitoes (60.9%) was found in polyculture, while the highest species richness (11 species) was observed in rainforest. Ae. aegypti was the predominant Aedes species, and exhibited high anthropophilic behavior inflicting 93.0% of total biting to humans. The biting rate of Aedes mosquitoes was 34.6 and 7.2-fold higher in polyculture and rural housing areas, respectively, compared to rainforest. Three species (Ae. aegypti, Ae. dendrophilus, and Ae. vittatus) bit humans in polyculture and rural housing areas, with respective biting rates of 21.48 and 4.48 females/person/day. Unexpectedly, all three species were also feeding during darkness. Aedes females showed bimodal daily feeding cycles with peaks at around 08:00 a.m. and 05:00 p.m. Host-seeking activities were interrupted between 11:00 a.m. and 02:00 p.m. in rural housing areas, while no such interruption was observed in polyculture. Some rainforest-dwelling Aedes species displayed little preference to feed on humans. Conclusions: In southeastern C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire, the agricultural land-use/land-cover changes due to the conversion of rainforest into oil palm monocultures influence the abundance, distribution, and host-seeking behaviors of anthropophagic and non-anthropophagic Aedes vectors. As a result, there is higher risk of humans to arbovirus transmission in polyculture and rural housing areas. There is a need for integrated vector management, including landscape epidemiology and ecotope-based vector control. ¬© 2017 Zahouli et al.

Understanding what drives urban transmission is hampered by inconsistencies in how ""urban"" contexts are defined. A dichotomized ""urban-rural"" approach, based on political boundaries may misclassify environments or fail to capture local drivers of risk. Small-scale agriculture in urban or peri-urban settings has been shown to be a major risk determinant. Methods: Household-level Anopheles abundance patterns in and around Malawi's commercial capital of Blantyre (~ 1.9 M pop.) were analysed. Clusters (N = 64) of five houses each located at 2.5 km intervals along eight transects radiating out from Blantyre city centre were sampled during rainy and dry seasons of 2015 and 2016. Mosquito densities were measured inside houses using aspirators to sample resting mosquitoes, and un-baited CDC light traps to sample host seeking mosquitoes. Results: Of 38,895 mosquitoes captured, 91% were female and 87% were Culex spp. Anopheles females (N = 5058) were primarily captured in light traps (97%). Anopheles abundance was greater during rainy seasons. Anopheles funestus was more abundant than Anopheles arabiensis, but both were found on all transects, and had similar associations with environmental risk factors. Anopheles funestus and An. arabiensis females significantly increased with distance from the urban centre, but this trend was not consistent across all transects. Presence of small-scale agriculture was predictive of greater Anopheles spp. abundance, even after controlling for urbanicity, number of nets per person, number of under-5-year olds, years of education, and season. Conclusions: This study revealed how small-scale agriculture along a rural-to-urban transition was associated with An. arabiensis and An. funestus indoor abundances, and that indoor Anopheles density can be high within Blantyre city limits, particularly where agriculture is present. Typical rural areas with lower house density and greater distance from urban centres reflected landscapes more suitable for Anopheles reproduction and house invasion. However, similar characteristics and elevated Anopheles abundances were also found around some houses within the city limits. Thus, dichotomous designations of ""urban"" or ""rural"" can obscure important heterogeneity in the landscape of Plasmodium transmission, suggesting the need for more nuanced assessment of urban malaria risk and prevention efforts. ¬© 2018 The Author(s).","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85048183775&doi=10.1186%2fs12936-018-2375-5&partnerID=40&md5=5eb8a0a706adfa1631c7e0ed28f12773","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/pubmed.csv",2

Over 90 percent Cameroonians are at risk of malaria infection, and ~ 41 percent have at least one episode of malaria each year. Historically, the rate of malaria infection in Cameroon has fluctuated over the years; the number of cases was about 2 million in 2010 and 2011. The Cameroonian malaria control programme faces an uphill task due to high prevalence of multidrug-resistant parasites and insecticide-resistant malaria vectors. Above all, continued human migration from the rural to urban areas as well as population exchange with adjoining countries, high rate of ecological instabilities caused by deforestation, poor housing, lack of proper sanitation and drainage system might have resulted in the recent increase in incidences of malaria and other vector-borne diseases in Cameroon.

The ecological complexity, dimensions, and temporal stability of the nidus are determined largely by pathogen natural history and vector bionomics. Host populations, transmission efficiency, and therefore pathogen amplification vary spatially, thereby creating a heterogeneous surface that may be defined by remote sensing and statistical tools.

However, there is still a paucity of data on the influence of LLIN use and other factors on mosquito bionomics in different epidemiological foci. The objective of this study was to provide updated data on the evolution of vector bionomics and malaria transmission patterns in the equatorial forest region of Cameroon over the period 2000-2017, during which LLIN coverage has increased substantially. Methods: The study was conducted in Olama and Nyabessan, two villages situated in the equatorial forest region. Mosquito collections from 2016-2017 were compared to those of 2000-2001. Mosquitoes were sampled using both human landing catches and indoor sprays, and were identified using morphological taxonomic keys. Specimens belonging to the An. gambiae complex were further identified using molecular tools. Insecticide resistance bioassays were undertaken on An. gambiae to assess the susceptibility levels to both permethrin and deltamethrin. Mosquitoes were screened for Plasmodium falciparum infection and blood-feeding preference using the ELISA technique. Parasitological surveys in the population were conducted to determine the prevalence of Plasmodium infection using rapid diagnostic tests. Results: A change in the species composition of sampled mosquitoes was recorded between the 2000-2001 collections and those of 2016-2017. A drop in the density of the local primary vectors An. nili and An. moucheti in the forest region was recorded, whereas there was an increase in the density of An. gambiae (s.l.), An. marshallii, An. ziemannii and An. paludis. A change in the biting behaviour from indoor to outdoor was recorded in Olama. Very few indoor resting mosquitoes were collected. A change in the night biting cycle was recorded with mosquitoes displaying a shift from night biting to late evening/early in the night. Several mosquitoes were found positive for Plasmodium infection, thus sustaining continuous transmission of malaria in both sites. Reduction of malaria transmission in Nyabessan was lower than that seen in Olama and associated with deforestation and the construction of a dam that may have enabled a more efficient vector, An. gambiae (s.l.), to invade the area. A high level of resistance to pyrethroids (permethrin and deltamethrin) was detected for An. gambiae in both sites. High parasite prevalence was recorded in both sites, with children of 0-16 years being the most affected. In both Olama and Nyabessan, bed net usage appeared to correlate to protection against malaria infection. Conclusions: The study shows important changes in the bionomics of vector populations and malaria transmission patterns in the equatorial forest region. The changes call for more concerted efforts to address challenges such as insecticide resistance, environmental modifications or behavioural changes affecting the performance of current control measures. ¬© 2018 The Author(s).","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85051841662&doi=10.1186%2fs13071-018-3049-4&partnerID=40&md5=63e252e2a818c0ae02bb4ecde7e7f67b","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/pubmed.csv",2

The vast majority of endogenous small RNAs produced by the siRNA and piRNA pathways originate from repetitive or transposable elements (TE). In D. melanogaster, TE-derived endogenous siRNAs and piRNAs are involved in genome surveillance and maintenance of genome integrity. In the medically relevant malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae TEs constitute 12-16% of the genome size. Genetic variations induced by TE activities are known to shape the genome landscape and to alter the fitness in An. gambiae. Results: Here, using bioinformatics approaches we analyzed the small RNA data sets from 6 libraries formally reported in a previous study and examined the expression of the mixed germline/somatic siRNAs and piRNAs produced in adult An. gambiae females. We characterized a large population of TE-derived endogenous siRNAs and piRNAs, which constitutes 56-60% of the total siRNA and piRNA reads in the analysed libraries. Moreover, we identified a number of protein coding genes producing gene-specific siRNAs and piRNAs that were generally expressed at much lower levels than the TE-associated small RNAs. Detailed sequence analysis revealed that An. gambiae piRNAs were produced by both ""ping-pong"" dependent (TE-associated piRNAs) and independent mechanisms (genic piRNAs). Similarly to D. melanogaster, more than 90% of the detected piRNAs were produced from TE-associated clusters in An. gambiae. We also found that biotic stress as blood feeding and infection with Plasmodium parasite, the etiological agent of malaria, modulated the expression levels of the endogenous siRNAs and piRNAs in An. gambiae. Conclusions: We identified a large and diverse set of the endogenously derived siRNAs and piRNAs that share common and distinct aspects of small RNA expression across insect species, and inferred their impact on TE and gene activity in An. gambiae. The TE-specific small RNAs produced by both the siRNA and piRNA pathways represent an important aspect of genome stability and genetic variation, which might have a strong impact on the evolution of the genome and vector competence in the malaria mosquitoes. ¬© 2015 Biryukova and Ye; licensee BioMed Central.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84928880399&doi=10.1186%2fs12864-015-1436-1&partnerID=40&md5=5837e8920e3680356b918c32e6c67c08","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/pubmed.csv",2

Because immunity to malaria is nonsterilizing and builds up slowly through repeated infections, commonly the parasite invades a host that is immunologically and physiologically different from its previous host. During the course of infection, the parasite must also keep pace with changes in host immune responses and red-blood-cell physiology. Here, we describe the ""selection landscape"" of the most virulent of the human malaria parasites, Plasmodium falciparum, and the adaptive mechanisms it uses to navigate through that landscape. Taking a cost-benefit view of parasite fitness, we consider the evolutionary outcomes of the most important forces of selection operating on the parasite, namely immunity, host death, drugs, mosquito availability, and coinfection.

The pattern of malaria transmission in the highland plateau ecosystems is less distinct due to the flat topography and diffuse hydrology resulting from numerous streams. The non-homogeneous distribution of larval breeding habitats in east African highlands obviously affects Anopheles spatial distribution which, consequently, leads to heterogeneous human exposure to malaria. Another delicate parameter in the fragile transmission risk of malaria in the highlands is the rapid loss of primary forest due to subsistence agriculture. The implication of this change in land cover on malaria transmission is that deforestation can lead to changes in microclimate of both adult and larval habitats hence increase larvae survival, population density, and gametocytes development in adult mosquitoes. Deforestation has been documented to enhancing vectorial capacity of Anopheles gambiae by nearly 100% compared to forested areas. Method: The study was conducted in five different ecosystems in the western Kenya highlands, two U-shaped valleys (Iguhu, Emutete), two V-shaped valleys (Marani, Fort Ternan), and one plateau (Shikondi) for 16 months among 6-to 15-year-old children. Exposure to malaria was tested using circumsporozoite protein (CSP) and merozoite surface protein immunochromatographic antibody tests. Malaria parasite was examined using different tools, which include microscopy based on blood smears, rapid diagnostic test based on HRP 2 proteins, and serology based on human immune response to parasite and vector antigens have been also examined in the highlands in comparison with different topographical systems of western Kenya. Results: The results suggested that changes in the topography had implication on transmission in highlands of western Kenya and appropriate diagnosis, treatment, and control tool needed to be considered accordingly. Both plateau and U-shaped valley found to have higher parasite density than V-shaped valley. People in V-valley were less immune than in plateau and U-valley residents. Conclusion: Topography diversity in western Kenya highlands has a significant impact on exposure rates of human to malaria vectors and parasite. The residents of V-shaped valleys are at risk of having explosive malaria outbreaks during hyper-transmission periods due to low exposure to malaria parasite; hence, they have low immune response to malaria, while the U-shaped valleys have stable malaria transmission, therefore, the human population has developed immunity to malaria due to continuous exposure to malaria. ¬© 2016 Wanjala and Kweka.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85015295906&doi=10.3389%2fFPUBH.2016.00227&partnerID=40&md5=0c275ae7a6bd2a397dffe8be138297a0","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/pubmed.csv",2

Wasps displaced within their probable foraging grounds returned to their nests on the day of release although they oriented randomly upon release; however, wasps fed before release returned sooner, displaying nest-ward orientation. When displaced to places far from their nests, thus expected to be unfamiliar, only a third returned on the day of release showing nest-ward orientation; others oriented randomly and either returned on subsequent days or never. When confined within mosquito-net tents since eclosion and later released to places close to their nests (but unfamiliar), even fed wasps oriented randomly, and only older wasps returned, taking longer time. Thus, contrary to insects inhabiting less-featured landscapes, R. marginata foragers appear to have thorough familiarity with their foraging grounds that enables them to orient and home efficiently after passive displacement. Their initial orientation is, however, determined by an interaction of the information acquired from surrounding landscape and their physiological motivation. With age, they develop skills to home from unfamiliar places.

One hypothesis is that this increase is associated with changes in land use. A study was carried out to identify the anopheline vectors present in different forest types and to observe the human landing behaviour of mosquitoes. Methods: Mosquito collections were carried out using human landing catches at ground and canopy levels in the Tawau Division of Sabah. Collections were conducted along an anthropogenic disturbance gradient (primary forest, lightly logged virgin jungle reserve and salvage logged forest) between 18:00 and 22:00 h. Results: Anopheles balabacensis, a vector of P. knowlesi, was the predominant species in all collection areas, accounting for 70 % of the total catch, with a peak landing time of 18:30-20:00 h. Anopheles balabacensis had a preference for landing on humans at ground level compared to the canopy (p < 0.0001). A greater abundance of mosquitoes were landing in the logged forest compared to the primary forest (p < 0.0001). There was no difference between mosquito abundance in the logged forest and lightly logged forest (p = 0.554). A higher evening temperature (p < 0.0001) and rainfall (p < 0.0001) significantly decreased mosquito abundance during collection nights. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the potential ability of An. balabacensis to transmit P. knowlesi between canopy-dwelling simian hosts and ground-dwelling humans, and that forest disturbance increases the abundance of this disease vector.

Mosquitoes are the primary vectors of avian malaria and also the definitive hosts in the disease life cycle. Factors pertinent to mosquito ecology are likely to be influential to observed infection patterns; such factors include rainfall, season, temperature, and water quality. Methods. The influence of mosquito abundance and occurrence on the prevalence of Plasmodium spp. in the Ploceidae family (weavers) was examined, taking into account factors with an indirect influence upon mosquito ecology. Mosquitoes and weaver blood samples were simultaneously collected in the Western Cape, South Africa over a two-year period, and patterns of vector abundance and infection prevalence were compared. Dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature and salinity measurements were taken at 20 permanent waterbodies. Rainfall during this period was also quantified using remotely sensed data from up to 6 months prior to sampling months. Results: Sixteen wetlands had weavers infected with avian malaria. More than half of the mosquitoes caught were trapped at one site; when this site was excluded, the number of mosquitoes trapped did not vary significantly between sites. The majority of mosquitoes collected belonged to the predominant vector species group for avian malaria (Culex culex species complex). Seasonal variation occurred in infection and mosquito prevalence, water pH and water temperature, with greater variability observed in summer than in winter. There was a significant correlation of infection prevalence with rainfall two months prior to sampling months. Mosquito prevalence patterns across the landscape also showed a close relationship to patterns of rainfall. Contrary to predictions, a pattern of asynchronous co-variation occurred between mosquito prevalence and infection prevalence. Conclusion: Overall, salinity, rainfall, and mosquito prevalence and season were the most influential vector-related factors on infection prevalence. After comparison with related studies, the tentative conclusion drawn was that patterns of asynchronous variation between malaria prevalence and mosquito abundance were concurrent with those reported in lag response patterns. ¬© 2013 Okanga et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84886182109&doi=10.1186%2f1475-2875-12-370&partnerID=40&md5=f5c1b7bbfd24d98bb62d919cc3241e9a","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/pubmed.csv",2

These perturbations are expected to have strong impacts on ecological interactions and on the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases. To date, no clear picture of the effects of deforestation on vector-borne disease transmission has emerged. This is associated with the challenge of studying complex systems where many vertebrate hosts and vectors co-exist. To overcome this problem, we focused on an innately simplified system ‚Äì a small oceanic island (S√£o Tom√©, Gulf of Guinea). We analyzed the impacts of human land-use on host-parasite interactions by sampling the bird community (1735 samples from 30 species) in natural and anthropogenic land use at different elevations, and screened individuals for haemosporidian parasites from three genera (Plasmodium, Haemoproteus, Leucocytozoon). Overall, Plasmodium had the highest richness but the lowest prevalence, while Leucocytozoon diversity was the lowest despite having the highest prevalence. Interestingly, co-infections (i.e. intra-host diversity) involved primarily Leucocytozoon lineages (95%). We also found marked differences between bird species and habitats. Some bird species showed low prevalence but harbored high diversity of parasites, while others showed high prevalence but were infected with fewer lineages. These infection dynamics are most likely driven by host specificity of parasites and intrinsic characteristics of hosts. In addition, Plasmodium was more abundant in disturbed habitats and at lower elevations, while Leucocytozoon was more prevalent in forest areas and at higher elevations. These results likely reflect the ecological requirements of their vectors: mosquitoes and black flies, respectively. ¬© 2020 Australian Society for Parasitology","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85095588232&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijpara.2020.08.005&partnerID=40&md5=ff2a88e85ae9ca494e62980d0a5304d9","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/pubmed.csv",2

Information on P. knowlesi malaria is lacking in most regions so the first step to understand the geographical distribution of disease risk is to define the distributions of the reservoir and vector species. Methods: We used macaque and mosquito species presence data, background data that captured sampling bias in the presence data, a boosted regression tree model and environmental datasets, including annual data for land classes, to predict the distributions of each vector and host species. We then compared the predicted distribution of each species with cover of each land class. Results: Fine-scale distribution maps were generated for three macaque host species (Macaca fascicularis, M. nemestrina and M. leonina) and two mosquito vector complexes (the Dirus Complex and the Leucosphyrus Complex). The Leucosphyrus Complex was predicted to occur in areas with disturbed, but not intact, forest cover (> 60 % tree cover) whereas the Dirus Complex was predicted to occur in areas with 10-100 % tree cover as well as vegetation mosaics and cropland. Of the macaque species, M. nemestrina was mainly predicted to occur in forested areas whereas M. fascicularis was predicted to occur in vegetation mosaics, cropland, wetland and urban areas in addition to forested areas. Conclusions: The predicted M. fascicularis distribution encompassed a wide range of habitats where humans are found. This is of most significance in the northern part of its range where members of the Dirus Complex are the main P. knowlesi vectors because these mosquitoes were also predicted to occur in a wider range of habitats. Our results support the hypothesis that conversion of intact forest into disturbed forest (for example plantations or timber concessions), or the creation of vegetation mosaics, will increase the probability that members of the Leucosphyrus Complex occur at these locations, as well as bringing humans into these areas. An explicit analysis of disease risk itself using infection data is required to explore this further. The species distributions generated here can now be included in future analyses of P. knowlesi infection risk. ¬© 2016 Moyes et al.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84966365375&doi=10.1186%2fs13071-016-1527-0&partnerID=40&md5=3ac5c6a52bf317280f4642f1a158d757","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/pubmed.csv",2

We show the existence of a globally stable steady state, and a threshold that determines whether a pathogen is either absent from all patches, or endemic and present at some level in all patches. Each patch is characterized by a local basic reproduction number, whose value predicts whether the disease is cleared or not when the patch is isolated: patches are known as ‚Äúdemographic sinks‚Äù if they have a local basic reproduction number less than one, and hence would clear the disease if isolated; patches with a basic reproduction number above one would sustain endemic infection in isolation, and become ‚Äúdemographic sources‚Äù of parasites when connected to other patches. Sources are also considered focal areas of transmission for the larger landscape, as they export excess parasites to other areas and can sustain parasite populations. We show how to determine the various basic reproduction numbers from steady state estimates in the patched network and knowledge of additional model parameters, hereby identifying parasite sources in the process. This is useful in the context of control of the infection on natural landscapes, because a commonly suggested strategy is to target focal areas, in order to make their corresponding basic reproduction numbers less than one, effectively turning them into sinks. We show that this is indeed a successful control strategy‚Äîalbeit a conservative and possibly expensive one‚Äîin case either the human host, or the vector does not move. However, we also show that when both humans and vectors move, this strategy may fail, depending on the specific movement patterns exhibited by hosts and vectors. ¬© 2016 Elsevier Inc.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84979619142&doi=10.1016%2fj.mbs.2016.06.012&partnerID=40&md5=0148cbbc445eca1021c0b1c78f1f52ab","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/pubmed.csv",2

Efforts to control these diseases have been underpinned by a theoretical framework developed for malaria by Ross and Macdonald, including models, metrics for measuring transmission, and theory of control that identifies key vulnerabilities in the transmission cycle. That framework, especially Macdonald's formula for R0 and its entomological derivative, vectorial capacity, are nowused to study dynamics and design interventions for many mosquito-borne diseases. A systematic review of 388 models published between 1970 and 2010 found that the vast majority adopted the Ross-Macdonald assumption of homogeneous transmission in a well-mixed population. Studies comparing models and data question these assumptions and point to the capacity to model heterogeneous, focal transmission as the most important but relatively unexplored component in current theory. Fine-scale heterogeneity causes transmission dynamics to be nonlinear, and poses problems for modeling, epidemiology and measurement. Novel mathematical approaches show how heterogeneity arises from the biology and the landscape on which the processes of mosquito biting and pathogen transmission unfold. Emerging theory focuses attention on the ecological and social context formosquito blood feeding, themovement of both hosts and mosquitoes, and the relevant spatial scales for measuring transmission and for modeling dynamics and control. ¬© The Author 2014.

Selected examples are considered from viral and parasitic infections (arboviruses, malaria, the leishmaniases, filariases, Chagas Disease and schistosomiasis) where disease patterns have been directly or indirectly influenced by loss of natural tropical forests. A wide range of activities have resulted in deforestation. These include colonisation and settlement, transmigrant programmes, logging, agricultural activities to provide for cash crops, mining, hydropower development and fuelwood collection. Each activity influences the prevalence, incidence and distribution of vector-borne disease. Three main regions are considered - South America, West & Central Africa and South-East Asia. In each, documented changes in vector ecology and behaviour and disease pattern have occurred. Such changes result from human activity at the forest interface and within the forest. They include both deforestation and reafforestation programmes. Deforestation, or activities associated with it, have produced new habitats for Anopheles darlingi mosquitoes and have caused malaria epidemics in South America. The different species complexes in South-East Asia (A. dirus, A. minimus, A. balabacensis) have been affected in different ways by forest clearance with different impacts on malaria incidence. The ability of zoophilic vectors to adapt to human blood as an alternative source of food and to become associated with human dwellings (peridomestic behaviour) have influenced the distribution of the leishmaniases in South America. Certain species of sandflies (Lutzomyia intermedia, Lu. longipalpis, Lu. whitmam), which were originally zoophilic and sylvatic, have adapted to feeding on humans in peridomestic and even periurban situations. The changes in behaviour of reservoir hosts and the ability of pathogens to adapt to new reservoir hosts in the newly-created habitats also influence the patterns of disease. In anthroponotic infections, such as Plasmodium, Onchocerca and Wuchereria, changes in disease patterns and vector ecology may be more difficult to detect. Detailed knowledge of vector species and species complexes is needed in relation to changing climate associated with deforestation. The distributions of the Anopheles gambiae and Simulium damnosum species complexes in West Africa are examples. There have been detailed longitudinal studies of Anopheles gambiae populations in different ecological zones of West Africa. Studies on Simulium damnosum cytoforms (using chromosome identification methods) in the Onchocerciasis Control Programme were necessary to detect changes in distribution of species in relation to changed habitats. These examples underline the need for studies on the taxonomy of medically-important insects in parallel with long-term observations on changing habitats. In some circumstances, destruction of the forest has reduced or even removed disease transmission (e.g. S. neavei-transmitted Onchocerca in Kenya). Whilst the process of deforestation can be expected to continue, hopefully at a decreased rate, it is expected that unpredictable and sometimes rapid changes in disease patterns will pose problems for the public health services. ¬© 1993, Cambridge University Press.

Our results show that Culex restuans is positive for avian malaria and it is feeding on both humans and domestic animals at urban and peri-urban habitat types, where it is also an abundant species throughout the year. Furthermore, Aedes quadrivittatus, also positive for avian malaria, is feeding on humans in the well-preserved cloud forest, where this mosquito species is highly abundant. This study is the first in Mexico to provide reference data showing generalist mosquito feeding preferences and presence of avian Plasmodium at locations with different land use types. ¬© 2018 Elsevier B.V.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041689648&doi=10.1016%2fj.parint.2018.01.006&partnerID=40&md5=7c7ad477f0c12ae3641eb9ca959b0bc9","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/pubmed.csv",2

Relative impacts of competition and predation change across a gradient of habitat size and permanence. Asymmetrical competition is common and ecological context changes competitive advantage, potentially facilitating landscape-level coexistence of competitors. Predator effects on mosquito populations sometimes depend on habitat structure and on emergent effects of multiple predators, particularly interference among predators. Nonlethal effects of predators on mosquito oviposition, foraging, and life history are common, and their consequences for populations and for mosquito-borne disease are poorly understood. Context-dependent beneficial effects of detritus shredders on mosquitoes occur in container habitats, but these interactions appear to involve more than simple resource modification by shredders. Investigations of context-dependent interactions among mosquito larvae will yield greater understanding of mosquito population dynamics and provide useful model systems for testing theories of context dependence in communities.

Evaluation of local transmission epidemiology to characterize malaria risk is essential for planning malaria control and elimination programmes. The use of geographical information systems (GIS) techniques has been a major asset to this approach. To assess time and space distribution of malaria disease in Bandiagara, Mali, within a transmission season, data were used from an ongoing malaria incidence study that enrolled 300 participants aged under six years old"". Methods. Children's households were georeferenced using a handheld global position system. Clinical malaria was defined as a positive blood slide for Plasmodium falciparum asexual stages associated with at least one of the following signs: headache, body aches, fever, chills and weakness. Daily rainfall was measured at the local weather station.Landscape features of Bandiagara were obtained from satellite images and field survey. QGIS‚Ñ¢ software was used to map malaria cases, affected and non-affected children, and the number of malaria episodes per child in each block of Bandiagara. Clusters of high or low risk were identified under SaTScan¬Æ software according to a Bernoulli model. Results: From June 2009 to May 2010, 296 clinical malaria cases were recorded. Though clearly temporally related to the rains, Plasmodium falciparum occurrence persisted late in the dry season. Two ""hot spots"" of malaria transmission also found, notably along the Yam√© River, characterized by higher than expected numbers of malaria cases, and high numbers of clinical episodes per child. Conversely, the north-eastern sector of the town had fewer cases despite its proximity to a large body of standing water which was mosquito habitat. Conclusion: These results confirm the existence of a marked spatial heterogeneity of malaria transmission in Bandiagara, providing support for implementation of targeted interventions. ¬© 2013 Coulibaly et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84874397091&doi=10.1186%2f1475-2875-12-82&partnerID=40&md5=de1861c4efc3539f78e2213c273a8912","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/pubmed.csv",2

Each environmental change, whether occurring as a natural phenomenon or through human intervention, changes the ecological balance and context within which disease hosts or vectors and parasites breed, develop, and transmit disease. Each species occupies a particular ecological niche and vector species sub-populations are distinct behaviourally and genetically as they adapt to man-made environments. Most zoonotic parasites display three distinct life cycles: sylvatic, zoonotic, and anthroponotic. In adapting to changed environmental conditions, including reduced non-human population and increased human population, some vectors display conversion from a primarily zoophyllic to primarily anthrophyllic orientation. Deforestation and ensuing changes in landuse, human settlement, commercial development, road construction, water control systems (dams, canals, irrigation systems, reservoirs), and climate, singly, and in combination have been accompanied by global increases in morbidity and mortality from emergent parasitic disease. The replacement of forests with crop farming, ranching, and raising small animals can create supportive habitats for parasites and their host vectors. When the landuse of deforested areas changes, the pattern of human settlement is altered and habitat fragmentation may provide opportunities for exchange and transmission of parasites to the heretofore uninfected humans. Construction of water control projects can lead to shifts in such vector populations as snails and mosquitoes and their parasites. Construction of roads in previously inaccessible forested areas can lead to erosion, and stagnant ponds by blocking the flow of streams when the water rises during the rainy season. The combined effects of environmentally detrimental changes in local landuse and alterations in global climate disrupt the natural ecosystem and can increase the risk of transmission of parasitic diseases to the human population.

Predatory natural enemies can contribute to the regulation of disease vector groups such as mosquitoes, particularly where they naturally co-occur across landscapes. However, we must understand inter-population variation in predatory efficiency if we are to enhance vector control. The present study thus employs a functional response (FR; resource use under different densities) approach to quantify and compare predatory interaction strengths among six populations of a predatory temporary pond specialist copepod, Lovenula raynerae, from the Eastern Cape of South Africa preying on second instar Culex pipiens complex mosquito larvae. All individuals from the sampled populations were predatory and drove significant mortality through per capita predation rates of 0.75-1.10 mosquitoes/h at maximum densities over a 5-h feeding time. Individuals from all copepod populations exhibited Type II FRs with no significant differences in attack rates. On the other hand, there were significant differences in handling times, and therefore also maximum feeding rates (maximum experimental prey density: 32), suggesting possible genetic differences among populations that influenced predation. Owing to a widespread distribution in arid landscapes, we propose that predatory calanoid copepods such as L. raynerae play a key regulatory role at the landscape scale in the control of disease vector mosquito populations. We propose that these ecosystems and their specialist biota should thus be conserved and enhanced (e.g., via selective breeding) owing to the ecosystem services they provide in the context of public health. ¬© The Author(s) 2020.

We used a new high-quality reference genome to re-evaluate previously described subpopulations among human and macaque isolates from Malaysian-Borneo and Peninsular-Malaysia. Nuclear genomes were dimorphic, as expected, but new evidence of chromosomal-segment exchanges between subpopulations was found. A large segment on chromosome 8 originating from the Mn subpopulation and containing genes encoding proteins expressed in mosquito-borne parasite stages, was found in Mf genotypes. By contrast, non-recombining organelle genomes partitioned into 3 deeply branched lineages, unlinked with nuclear genomic dimorphism.

The species in this subgenus are strongly associated with humid forests rich in epiphytic bromeliads. Forest fragmentation and anthropogenic changes can therefore have a negative impact on the abundance and survival of these mosquito species. Within this subgenus, four species are considered primary vectors of malaria: An. cruzii, An. bellator, An. homunculus and An. neivai. Malaria cases associated with Kerteszia species are often referred to as bromeliad malaria, a type of malaria reported to be endemic in the coastal rainforest of the neotropical region since the end of the nineteenth century. Although the incidence of bromeliad-malaria cases has decreased since the middle of the last century, autochthonous malaria cases continue to be registered every year. The complexity of the epidemiology of bromeliad malaria appears to be increasing as asymptomatic plasmodial infections and transmission of simian Plasmodium to humans have recently been reported. Kerteszia vector species have a great affinity for human beings and can be found in human-modified areas close to forest fragments such as in the Extra-Amazonian region of Brazil, Colombian pacific coast, and the Caribbean coast. Deforestation and forest fragmentation have been occurring continuously in the biomes of the neotropical region, and findings of Kerteszia species in dwellings are frequent in this region. Controlling the species in the Kerteszia subgenus is particularly difficult because they move frequently from natural to rural and peri-urban areas in search of blood sources, posing a challenge for the development of control strategies based on integrated vector management. Furthermore, as it has been shown that some Kerteszia species share similar morphological and genetic characteristics, the existence of a species complex formed by cryptic, sibling species within the Kerteszia group in different areas in the South and Southeast of Brazil cannot be ruled out. The existence of such a complex could represent an obstacle to the control of Kerteszia species and consequently to the elimination of bromeliad-malaria transmission in these regions. Here, we review publications that focus on the biology and ecology of Kerteszia malaria vectors and their association with human-modified areas and bromeliad-malaria transmission. ¬© 2020 Elsevier B.V.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85080052129&doi=10.1016%2fj.actatropica.2020.105413&partnerID=40&md5=cc3725be348cee8c514e28975f9ae229","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/pubmed.csv",2

It is also a phenomenon that pertains to the realm of community ecology, since blood-feeding patterns of vectors can occur across a community of vertebrate hosts. Although great advances in knowledge of the genetic basis for blood-feeding choices have been reported for selected vector species, little is known about the role of community composition of vertebrate hosts in determining such patterns.Methods & Results: Here, we present an analysis of feeding patterns of vectors across a variety of locations, looking at foraging patterns of communities of mosquitoes, across communities of hosts primarily comprised of mammals and birds. Using null models of species co-occurrence, which do not require ancillary information about host abundance, we found that blood-feeding patterns were aggregated in studies from multiple sites, but random in studies from a single site. This combination of results supports the idea that mosquito species in a community may rely primarily on host availability in a given landscape, and that contacts with specific hosts will be influenced more by the presence/absence of hosts than by innate mosquito choices. This observation stresses the importance of blood-feeding plasticity as a key trait explaining the emergence of many zoonotic mosquito transmitted diseases.Discussion: From an epidemiological perspective our observations support the idea that phenomena promoting synchronization of vectors and hosts can promote the emergence of vector-borne zoonotic diseases, as suggested by observations on the linkages between deforestation and the emergence of several human diseases. ¬© 2010 Chaves et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77349095287&doi=10.1186%2f1742-9994-7-3&partnerID=40&md5=b3eeadd152747dfbadaec3ac246348e5","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/pubmed.csv",2

Frequent epidemic outbreaks are believed to be driven by a complex interplay of immunological interactions between its four co-circulating serotypes and large fluctuations in mosquito densities. Viral lineage replacement events, caused for example by different levels of crossprotection or differences in viral fitness, have also been linked to a temporary change in dengue epidemiology. A major replacement event was recently described for South-East Asia where the Asian-1 genotype of dengue serotype 2 replaced the resident Asian/American type. Although this was proposed to be due to increased viral fitness in terms of enhanced human-to-mosquito transmission, no major change in dengue epidemiology could be observed. Methods/Results: Here we investigate the invasion dynamics of a novel, advantageous dengue genotype within a model system and determine the factors influencing the success and rate of fixation as well as their epidemiological consequences. We find that while viral fitness overall correlates with invasion success and competitive exclusion of the resident genotype, the epidemiological landscape plays a more significant role for successful emergence. Novel genotypes can thus face high risks of stochastic extinction despite their fitness advantage if they get introduced during episodes of high dengue prevalence, especially with respect to that particular serotype. Conclusion: The rarity of markers for positive selection has often been explained by strong purifying selection whereby the constraints imposed by dengue's two-host cycle are expected to result in a high rate of deleterious mutations. Our results demonstrate that even highly beneficial mutants are under severe threat of extinction, which would suggest that apart from purifying selection, stochastic effects and genetic drift beyond seasonal bottlenecks are equally important in shaping dengue's viral ecology and evolution. ¬© 2010 Louren√ßo, Recker.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-78649772319&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pntd.0000894&partnerID=40&md5=0d32dc5fca2cd7aca3dd82bef53a46dd","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/pubmed.csv",2

Despite high rates of urbanization and ample examples of vector-borne diseases transmitted by multiple species, the effects of urbanization-driven mosquito diversity losses on disease transmission has not been well explored. We investigated this question using the dog heartworm, a filarial parasite vectored by numerous mosquito species. Methods: We trapped host-seeking mosquitoes in undeveloped areas and neighborhoods of different ages in Wake County, North Carolina, USA, analyzing captured mosquitoes for heartworm DNA. We compared within-mosquito heartworm infection across land-use types by Kruskal-Wallis and likelihood ratio tests. Using zip code level data acquired from dogs in a local shelter, we performed linear regressions of within-host heartworm prevalence by within-mosquito heartworm prevalence as well as by three mosquito diversity measures. We also determined the best predictor of host-level prevalence among models including within-mosquito infection, mosquito diversity and abundance, and socioeconomic status as variables. Results: Suburban areas had lower within-mosquito heartworm prevalence and lower likelihood of heartworm-positive mosquitoes than did undeveloped field sites, although no differences were seen between suburban and undeveloped wooded sites. No relationships were noted between within-mosquito and within-host heartworm prevalence. However, mosquito diversity metrics were positively correlated with host heartworm prevalence. Model selection revealed within-host prevalence was best predicted by a positive relationship with mosquito Shannon-Wiener diversity and a negative relationship with household income. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that decreases in mosquito diversity due to urbanization alter vector-borne disease risk. With regard to dog heartworm disease, this loss of mosquito diversity is associated with decreased heartworm prevalence within both the vector and the host. Although the response is likely different for diseases transmitted by one or few species, mosquito diversity losses leading to decreased transmission could be generalizable to other pathogens with multiple vectors.

We adopt ecological theory underlying foraging in herbivorous insects to vector mosquito host seeking and modelling of fine-scale landscape features at the village level. The overall effect of environmental variables on the density of indoor mosquitoes, sporozoite infected mosquitoes, and malaria incidence, was determined using generalized linear models. Spatial analyses were used to identify hotspots for malaria incidence, as well as malaria vector density and associated sporozoite prevalence.

Rapid expansion of urban populations and alteration of natural habitats creates the opportunity for arboviruses to host-switch from wild, sylvatic hosts or vectors into urban transmission affecting human populations. Although mosquito surveillance regularly takes place in urban areas of Kenya, for example identifying vectors of dengue virus or malaria viruses, little work has been carried out to determine the distribution and abundance of sylvatic vectors. Here, we describe the mosquito vector species and diversity collected at twelve forest habitats of rural Kenya. We conducted arbovirus screening of over 14,082 mosquitoes (47 species, 11 genera) as 1520 pools, and detected seven viruses (six bunyaviruses, and one flavivirus-bunyavirus co-infection) isolated from pools of Aedes dentatus, Anopheles funestus, Culex annulioris, and Cx. vansomereni. Awareness of sylvatic vector species and their location is a critical part of understanding the ecological foci and enzootic cycling of pathogens that may be of concern to public, animal or wildlife health.

We examined how adult host-seeking mosquitoes respond to small-scale habitat differences within southern Great Plains cross-timber habitat mosaics in northern Oklahoma consisting of eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginianus L.) woodlands, mixed-deciduous woodlands, and adjacent grasslands. Mosquitoes responded most markedly to an overall grassland-woodland habitat gradient, with species separating by habitat based largely on tree density. Differences in abundance of host-seeking females occurred at fine spatial scales, sometimes varying dramatically over distances as little as 200 m when tree density changed abruptly. Tree type was not as important as tree density, although the West Nile virus vector Culex tarsalis Coquillett showed a greater affinity for areas containing eastern red cedar than for deciduous woodlands. The invasive Aedes albopictus Skuse showed equal affinity for both tree types.

Results: Positive mosquito pools revealed low infection prevalence, but suggested a continuous circulation of both Usutu virus and insect Flavivirus. Interestingly, phylogenetic analyses based on NS5 gene partial sequences showed a closer relationship among new Usutu virus strains from Piedmont and the reference sequences from the Eastern Europe, with respect to Italian samples characterized so far.

Large-scale vector control interventions in Cambodia are based on the free distribution of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs), targeting indoor- and late-biting malaria vectors only. The present study evaluated the vector density, early biting activity and malaria transmission of outdoor-biting malaria vectors in two forested regions in Cambodia. Methods. In 2005 two entomological surveys were conducted in 12 villages and their related forest plots in the east and west of Cambodia. Mosquitoes were collected outdoors by human landing collections and subjected to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect Plasmodium sporozoites after morphological identification. Blood samples were collected in the same villages for serological analyses. Collected data were analysed by the classification and regression tree (CART) method and linear regression analysis. Results: A total of 11,826 anophelines were recorded landing in 787 man-night collections. The majority (82.9%) were the known primary and secondary vectors. Most of the variability in vector densities and early biting rates was explained by geographical factors, mainly at village level. Vector densities were similar between forest and village sites. Based on ELISA results, 29% out of 17 Plasmodium-positive bites occurred before sleeping time, and 65% in the forest plots. The entomological inoculation rates of survey 1 were important predictors of the respective seroconversion rates in survey 2, whereas the mosquito densities were not. Discussion. In Cambodia, outdoor malaria transmission in villages and forest plots is important. In this context, deforestation might result in lower densities of the primary vectors, but also in higher densities of secondary vectors invading deforested areas. Moreover, higher accessibility of the forest could result in a higher man-vector contact. Therefore, additional vector control measures should be developed to target outdoor- and early-biting vectors. ¬© 2013 Durnez et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84883883427&doi=10.1186%2f1475-2875-12-329&partnerID=40&md5=6a7a1a69fcfd86e2969b175bac293893","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/pubmed.csv",2

They are being investigated as tools to manipulate the populations of important vectors of human disease, in particular the mosquitoes that transmit malaria. Before HEGs can be deployed, it is important to study their spatial spread in order to design efficient release strategies. A spatially explicit model is developed to study the spread of a HEG through a landscape whose structure is defined by the distribution of mosquito breeding and feeding sites. The model is motivated by the biology of the major vectors of malaria in Africa. The conditions for spread, fixation and loss of two major types of HEG are explored in different landscapes. In landscapes where mosquito resources are abundant, the conditions for spread are well approximated by a mean-field model. Where a HEG imposes a genetic load, it can cause population extinction, though spatial models more often predict population suppression. In certain types of landscapes where mosquito resources are rare, an introduced HEG may be prevented from moving between local mosquito populations and so a simple release strategy is unlikely to be effective, yet if the HEG succeeds in spreading population extinction is a feasible outcome. Increasing the number of release sites at the expense of releasing fewer mosquitoes per site reduces the probability that a HEG will fail. Synthesis and applications. The model presented asks for the first time how the spatial structure of mosquito populations will influence the effectiveness of a technology that is being rapidly developed for vector control. If homing endonuclease genes (HEGs) are to be used in this way, we have qualified the importance of accounting for landscape characteristics in both the execution and the expectation of their application.

The model presented asks for the first time how the spatial structure of mosquito populations will influence the effectiveness of a technology that is being rapidly developed for vector control. If homing endonuclease genes (HEGs) are to be used in this way, we have qualified the importance of accounting for landscape characteristics in both the execution and the expectation of their application.

Although the impact of temperature on vector-borne disease dynamics has been studied intensively, the actual temperature encountered by the vector in a heterogeneous landscape is rarely taken into account. If disease vectors have temperature preferences and therefore select specific microhabitats, this would substantially influence key life history traits that determine transmission intensity. The thermal preferences of subtropical Aedes aegypti and temperate Ae. japonicus mosquitoes were investigated in a temperature gradient set-up consisting of a Plexiglas box on top of an aluminium plate on two thermal regulators. Blood-fed (one day after feeding) and unfed (non-blood-fed) mosquitoes were released in small (15‚Äì20 ¬∞C, 20‚Äì25 ¬∞C, 25‚Äì30 ¬∞C) and large (15‚Äì30 ¬∞C, 30‚Äì45 ¬∞C) temperature gradients to assess their thermal preferences after 15 min. Additionally, the effect of humidity was investigated in a two-choice chamber setup. Both mosquito species avoided higher temperatures, pronouncedly dangerously high temperatures in the 30‚Äì45 ¬∞C gradient. At lower temperatures, blood-fed mosquitoes preferred the cooler sides of the 20‚Äì25 ¬∞C and 25‚Äì30 ¬∞C gradient, which were all below their rearing temperature. In the lowest gradient of 15‚Äì20 ¬∞C, no preferences were found. The thermal preference of unfed mosquitoes was similar to that of the blood-fed mosquitoes. No humidity preference or effect of humidity on temperature preferences was observed within the tested range (40‚Äì90%). The set-up allows for assessing the thermal preference of mosquitoes under controlled conditions. The observed preference of mosquitoes for cooler temperatures would increase their longevity and slow down pathogen development. If similar microhabitat selection is observed in the field, vector borne disease models should be adjusted accordingly. ¬© 2020 Elsevier Ltd","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086703919&doi=10.1016%2fj.jtherbio.2020.102637&partnerID=40&md5=6171b56a86db42f7568e32a91eefba76","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/pubmed.csv",2

A GIS was developed based on official cartography with thematic overlays depicting malaria distribution, socio-economic conditions, basic environmental information and specific features associated with the natural wetlands present in the area. Generally, malaria foci are continuously active but when the malaria situation was modelled in the north-oriental focus, a differential, spatio-temporal distribution pattern situation was found, i.e. a situation oscillating between very active and dormant transmission. This pattern was displayed by spatial and statistical analysis based on the model generated in this study and the results were confirmed by municipal and county malaria records.

Effectiveness of treated nets depends on direct impacts on individual mosquitoes including killing and excite-repellency, which vary considerably among vector species due to variations in host-seeking behaviours. While monitoring and evaluation programmes of ITNs have focuses on morbidity and all-cause mortality in humans, local entomological context receives little attention. Without knowing the dynamics of local vector species and their responses to treated nets, it is difficult to predict clinical outcomes when ITN applications are scaled up across African continent. Sound model frameworks incorporating intricate interactions between mosquitoes and treated nets are needed to develop the predictive capacity for scale-up applications of ITNs. Methods: An established agent-based model was extended to incorporate the direct outcomes, e.g. killing and avoidance, of individual mosquitoes exposing to ITNs in a hypothetical village setting with 50 houses and 90 aquatic habitats. Individual mosquitoes were tracked throughout the life cycle across the landscape. Four levels of coverage, i.e. 40, 60, 80 and 100%, were applied at the household level with treated houses having only one bed net. By using Latin hypercube sampling scheme, parameters governing killing, diverting and personal protection of net users were evaluated for their relative roles in containing mosquito populations, entomological inoculation rates (EIRs) and malaria incidence. Results: There were substantial gaps in coverage between households and individual persons, and 100% household coverage resulted in circa 50% coverage of the population. The results show that applications of ITNs could give rise to varying impacts on population-level metrics depending on values of parameters governing interactions of mosquitoes and treated nets at the individual level. The most significant factor in determining effectiveness was killing capability of treated nets. Strong excito-repellent effect of impregnated nets might lead to higher risk exposure to non-bed net users. Conclusion: With variabilities of vector mosquitoes in host-seeking behaviours and the responses to treated nets, it is anticipated that scale-up applications of INTs might produce varying degrees of success dependent on local entomological and epidemiological contexts. This study highlights that increased ITN coverage led to significant reduction in risk exposure and malaria incidence only when treated nets yielded high killing effects. It is necessary to test efficacy of treated nets on local dominant vector mosquitoes, at least in laboratory, for monitoring and evaluation of ITN programmes. ¬© 2009 Gu and Novak; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-72749085588&doi=10.1186%2f1475-2875-8-256&partnerID=40&md5=2cc199775c26807ea4c8c00db806a070","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/pubmed.csv",2

We used specific physiological and behavioral ecology bird data, and Po'ouli morphological and spectral data obtained from museum specimens to address ecological and conservation-related questions about the Po'ouli that are otherwise very difficult to quantify. Laboratory and field tested microclimate and biophysical - behavioral animal computer models were integrated with remote sensing technologies. To show that the generic microclimate and endotherm models can predict metabolic and water loss requirements of Hawaiian Honeycreepers, we used the 2 species with known physiological properties, the Hawaiian Amakihi, Hemignathus virens, and the Hawaiian Anianiau, Hemignathus parvus. Predictions were within experimental measurement error of the laboratory measurements. Then using field rather than laboratory conditions as input data, we predict the field distribution of the Amakihi on Maui as the first spatial test of the models applied to birds. Results are consistent with Amakihi field distribution data. Fossils show that the Po'ouli once lived on Maui at low elevations in dry/mesic habitats on a likely diet of native tree snails and insects. The arrival of lethal mosquito-borne avian malaria in Hawaii exterminated low elevation Po'ouli forcing a population shift to mountain rainforests and possibly a snail diet instead of insects. To explore the maximum consequences of such a diet shift we assumed exclusive diets of snails versus insects at both low and high elevations. Snail diets require ‚àº4 times higher foraging rates than do insect diets, making a predominantly snail diet an unlikely prospect for the Po'ouli. Landscape scale simulations suggest that a snail diet would force a Po'ouli distribution inconsistent with observations. A predominantly insect diet is consistent with distribution observations. We show that as local environmental conditions change across the landscape in space and diurnal/seasonal time it is possible to quantify animal physiological and behavioral consequences of those variations in their local environment. This enables quantification of the requisite spatial and temporal distribution and amount or availability of resources that may affect species' potential for survival, growth, reproduction and distribution. ¬© The Author 2006.

Here, we used spatially-explicit models to evaluate how three land-use types (orchards, vegetable/forage crops, natural) and two climatic variables (temperature, precipitation) influence the prevalence of WNV infections and vector/host distributions at landscape and local spatial scales. Across landscapes, we show that orchard habitats were associated with greater prevalence of WNV infections in reservoirs (birds) and incidental hosts (horses), while increased precipitation was associated with fewer infections. At local scales, orchard habitats increased the prevalence of WNV infections in vectors (mosquitoes) and the abundance of mosquitoes and two key reservoir species, the American robin and the house sparrow.

We experimentally examined the relative impact of native and introduced predatory fish on a temporary wetland amphibian assemblage to determine whether these predators exert distinct (unique or non-substitutable) or equivalent (similar) impacts on prey. Predatory fish included the eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki), golden top-minnow (Fundulus chrysotus), flagfish (Jordanella floridae), and the introduced walking catfish (Clarias batrachus). The tadpole assemblage included four common species known to co-occur in temporary wetlands in south-central Florida, USA: the oak toad (Bufo quercicus), pinewoods treefrog (Hyla femoralis), squirrel treefrog (Hyla squirella), and eastern narrowmouth toad (Gastrophryne carolinensis). Tadpoles were exposed to different predators in wading pools under conditions similar to those found in surrounding temporary wetlands (particularly in terms of substrate type, the degree of habitat complexity, and temperature). Native predators were similar with respect to predation rate and prey selectivity, suggesting similar energy requirements and foraging behavior. Conversely, native fish predators, especially G. holbrooki, were distinct from the introduced C. batrachus. In contrast to expectations, C. batrachus were less voracious predators than native fish, particularly G. holbrooki. Moreover, survival of G. carolinensis and H. femoralis were higher in the presence of C. batrachus than G. holbrooki. We suggest that C. batrachus was a less efficient predator than native fish because the foraging behavior of this species resulted in low predator-prey encounter rates, and thus predation rate. In combination with a related field study, our results suggest that native predatory fish play a stronger role than C. batrachus in influencing the spatial distribution and abundance of temporary wetland amphibians in the landscape.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0042710928&doi=10.1007%2fs00442-003-1251-2&partnerID=40&md5=c0f62546776589fa7389486c5021c569","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/pubmed.csv",2

Since bromeliaceae function as a 'host of the carrier' and were previously associated with natural forests, the elucidation of bromeliad malaria historically elicited controversies concerning the imputation of Kertesziae as transmitters as well as over control strategies directed to bromelia eradication (manual removal, herbicides and deforestation), use of insecticides and chemoprophylaxis. Established authority, disciplinary traditions, conceptual premises and contemporary criteria for validating knowledge in the field partly explain the long time gap since Adolpho Lutz announced at the beginning of the century the existence of a new mosquito and breeding site as responsible for a 'forest malaria' epidemic occurring at a high altitude. The article brings attention to how economic, political and institutional determinants played an important role in redefining studies that led both in Trinidad and Brazil to the recognition of the importance of kerteszia transmission, including urban areas, and establishing new approaches to its study, most relevant of all the concurrence of broad ecological research. The article then describes the Brazilian campaign strategies which showed significant short-term results but had to wait four decades to achieve the goal of eradication due to the peculiar characteristics of this pathogenic complex.

Malaria is still prevalent in rural communities of central Vietnam even though, due to deforestation, the primary vector Anopheles dirus is uncommon. In these situations little is known about the secondary vectors which are responsible for maintaining transmission. Basic information on the identification of the species in these rural communities is required so that transmission parameters, such as ecology, behaviour and vectorial status can be assigned to the appropriate species. Methods. In two rural villages - Khe Ngang and Hang Chuon - in Truong Xuan Commune, Quang Binh Province, north central Vietnam, a series of longitudinal entomological surveys were conducted during the wet and dry seasons from 2003 - 2007. In these surveys anopheline mosquitoes were collected in human landing catches, paired human and animal bait collections, and from larval surveys. Specimens belonging to species complexes were identified by PCR and sequence analysis, incrimination of vectors was by detection of circumsporozoite protein using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results. Over 80% of the anopheline fauna was made up of Anopheles sinensis, Anopheles aconitus, Anopheles harrisoni, Anopheles maculatus, Anopheles sawadwongporni, and Anopheles philippinensis. PCR and sequence analysis resolved identification issues in the Funestus Group, Maculatus Group, Hyrcanus Group and Dirus Complex. Most species were zoophilic and while all species could be collected biting humans significantly higher densities were attracted to cattle and buffalo. Anopheles dirus was the most anthropophilic species but was uncommon making up only 1.24% of all anophelines collected. Anopheles sinensis, An. aconitus, An. harrisoni, An. maculatus, An. sawadwongporni, Anopheles peditaeniatus and An. philippinensis were all found positive for circumsporozoite protein. Heterogeneity in oviposition site preference between species enabled vector densities to be high in both the wet and dry seasons allowing for year round transmission. Conclusions. In rural communities in north central Vietnam, malaria transmission was maintained by a number of anopheline species which though collected feeding on humans were predominantly zoophilic, this behaviour allows for low level but persistent malaria transmission. The important animal baits - cattle and buffalo - were kept in the village and barrier spraying around these animals may be more effective at reducing vector densities and longevity than the currently used indoor residual spraying. ¬© 2010 Do Manh et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77956606638&doi=10.1186%2f1475-2875-9-259&partnerID=40&md5=2a79e3001300348fe08b5e60d9cbc74f","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/pubmed.csv",2

Efficacy of replicate applications was evaluated by measuring mortality among caged sentinel mosquitoes, by evaluating changes in host-seeking abundance at replicated dry ice-baited traps positioned along intersecting east-west and north-south transects, and by differential recapture patterns of marked females released near traps in the sprayed central core and unsprayed control areas. Sentinel mortality agreed well with estimates of droplet density measured by ""slide spinners"" and was affected by 1) distance of cages from the truck route; 2) landscape features, such as tree lines that created wind shadows; 3) irregular landscape that disrupted the particle cloud; 4) low wind speed that failed to carry the droplet cloud through the environment; and 5) failure of the droplets to penetrate dead airspace within stands of vegetation. Despite variable sentinel mortality, Culex tarsalis relative abundance in rural landscapes within and around our study areas always declined after ULV applications. Concurrent decreases in abundance at traps within sprayed and adjoining unsprayed areas confounded our estimates of percentage of control using Mulla's formula, which compares abundance in sprayed and unsprayed areas pre- and postspray. ULV applications significantly affected recapture patterns, in that recapture rates within the spray zone usually were significantly less than in the unsprayed zone. Collectively, our data indicated that ground ULV applications measurably reduced Cx. tarsalis abundance in rural areas of the Coachella Valley but that further evaluations may be necessary to validate efficacy on Culex quinquefasciatus populations in residential communities.

The contribution of different environmental variables to the niche models was also assessed. Suitable habitats for Culex pipiens, Aedes albopictus, and Anopheles maculipennis were widely distributed; Culex modestus, Ochlerotatus geniculatus, Ochlerotatus caspius, Coquillettidia richiardii, Aedes vexans, and Anopheles plumbeus were concentrated in north-central Italy; Aedes cinereus, Culex theileri, Ochlerotatus dorsalis, and Culiseta longiareolata were restricted to coastal/southern areas.

Our study is, we believe, the first to present a statistical model of dispersal probability against distance from breeding habitat to human settlements for this important disease vector. Methods/Principal Findings: We undertook post-hoc analyses of mosquito catches made in The Gambia to derive statistical dispersal functions for An. gambiae sensu lato collected in 48 villages at varying distances to alluvial larval habitat along the River Gambia. The proportion dispersing declined exponentially with distance, and we estimated that 90% of movements were within 1.7 km. Although a 'heavy-tailed' distribution is considered biologically more plausible due to active dispersal by mosquitoes seeking blood meals, there was no statistical basis for choosing it over a negative exponential distribution. Using a simple random walk model with daily survival and movements previously recorded in Burkina Faso, we were able to reproduce the dispersal probabilities observed in The Gambia. Conclusions/Significance: Our results provide an important quantification of the probability of An. gambiae s.l. dispersal in a rural African setting typical of many parts of the continent. However, dispersal will be landscape specific and in order to generalise to other spatial configurations of habitat and hosts it will be necessary to produce tractable models of mosquito movements for operational use. We show that simple random walk models have potential. Consequently, there is a pressing need for new empirical studies of An. gambiae survival and movements in different settings to drive this development. ¬© 2013 Thomas et al.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84880438043&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0068679&partnerID=40&md5=1b3c084093a75eaef89f47763b29b899","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/pubmed.csv",2

To date there has been a lack of a systematic investigation in the United States, at a regional scale, of the wide variety of landscape, land use, and demographic influences on WNV incidence. In this study, we use published vector species distribution maps, as well as prominent landscape features, to define six distinct regions of the coterminous United States. We relate data on demographic, landscape, and land use conditions to the incidence of human WNV by region recorded at county level in the coterminous United States from 2002-2009. The observed relationships varied by region with the Great Plains, Northwest, and Southwest regions showing high WNV incidence associated with rural irrigated landscapes, indicating the importance of Culex tarsalis as the primary vector. In the Southeast, the percent of the population in poverty was positively associated with high WNV incidence, potentially indicating the quality of housing in relation to the vector Culex quinquefasciatus, a mosquito that often feeds indoors. The Northeast region human WNV incidence was positively associated with agricultural landscapes, potentially implying the importance of Culex restuans in a region generally thought of as being dominated by Culex pipiens transmission. There was strong spatial autocorrelation in most of the regions, but with a spatial autologistic term accounted for in binary logistic regression models, there were significant landscape, land use, and demographic covariates for each region. ¬© Copyright 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2012.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84865008886&doi=10.1089%2fvbz.2011.0786&partnerID=40&md5=d70fc3b1fd3c9c23364a18cae20a0cff","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/pubmed.csv",2

With increasing urbanization and the resulting emergence of zoonotic diseases, it is critical to understand the relationships among birds, vectors, zoonotic pathogens, and the urban landscape. Here, we use wild birds as sentinels across a gradient of urbanization to understand the relative risk of diseases caused by three types of zoonotic pathogens: Salmonella pathogens, mosquito-borne West Nile virus (WNV) and tick-borne pathogens, including the agents of Lyme disease and human anaplasmosis. Wild birds were captured using mist nets at five sites throughout greater Chicago, Illinois, and blood, faecal and ectoparasite samples were collected for diagnostic testing. A total of 289 birds were captured across all sites. A total of 2.8% of birds harboured Ixodes scapularis- the blacklegged tick - of which 54.5% were infected with the agent of Lyme disease, and none were infected with the agent of human anaplasmosis. All infested birds were from a single site that was relatively less urban. A single bird, captured at the only field site in which supplemental bird feeding was practised within the mist netting zone, was infected with Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica. While no birds harboured WNV in their blood, 3.5% of birds were seropositive, and birds from more urban sites had higher exposure to the virus than those from less urban sites. Our results demonstrate the presence of multiple bird-borne zoonotic pathogens across a gradient of urbanization and provide an assessment of potential public health risks to the high-density human populations within the area. ¬© 2012 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84864050906&doi=10.1111%2fj.1863-2378.2012.01462.x&partnerID=40&md5=e8589808af2720c315768aa03f852561","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/pubmed.csv",2

Thus, heterogeneity in human biting reflects underlying spatial heterogeneity in the distribution and suitability of larval habitat as well as inherent differences in the attractiveness, suitability and distribution of blood-meal hosts. One of the possible strategies of malaria control is to identify local vector species and then attack water bodies that contain their larvae. Methods: Biting and host seeking, not oviposition, have been the focus of most previous studies of mosquitoes and malaria transmission. This study presents a mathematical model that incorporates mosquito oviposition behaviour. Results: The model demonstrates that oviposition is one potential factor explaining heterogeneous biting and vector distribution in a landscape with a heterogeneous distribution of larval habitat. Adult female mosquitoes tend to aggregate around places where they oviposit, thereby increasing the risk of malaria, regardless of the suitability of the habitat for larval development. Thus, a water body may be unsuitable for adult mosquito emergence, but simultaneously, be a source for human malaria. Conclusion: Larval density may be a misleading indicator of a habitat's importance for malaria control. Even if mosquitoes could be lured to oviposit in sprayed larval habitats, this would not necessarily mitigate - and might aggravate - the risk of malaria transmission. Forcing mosquitoes to fly away from humans in search of larval habitat may be a more efficient way to reduce the risk of malaria than killing larvae. Thus, draining, fouling, or filling standing water where mosquitoes oviposit can be more effective than applying larvicide. ¬© 2005 Menach et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-23244453707&doi=10.1186%2f1475-2875-4-23&partnerID=40&md5=7f51a342d9276f25e9856beebbc24a25","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/pubmed.csv",2

All second-step mutations involved replacements by glutamine or glutamic acid of E2 glycoprotein amino acids in the acid-sensitive region, providing a framework to anticipate additional A. albopictus-adaptive mutations.

Disturbed and fragmented habitats allow some vector mosquitoes to thrive. The New Zealand landscape has been extensively modified since the arrival of humans, and there is accumulating evidence that the distribution of mosquitoes is being altered as a result of anthropogenic environmental changes. This study aimed to assess whether forest habitat size affected the community composition of mosquitoes, and whether the density of the introduced brushtail possum would benefit exotic mosquito species that feed primarily on mammal hosts. Extensive sampling of the mosquito community was carried out using dry ice-baited light traps, oviposition traps, and larval surveys. The results provided the first experimental evidence in New Zealand that changes in forest habitat size affect the indigenous and introduced mosquito fauna differently. The proportion of native species making up the mosquito community appears to be steadily reduced as native forest habitats become smaller. In contrast, the opposite pattern appears to occur for the introduced vector Aedes notoscriptus. Although there was a trend indicating that possums may have a negative impact on a native species (Culex pervigilans), the impact of these animals on the mosquito fauna remains unclear. The evidence suggests that the conservation of large pristine forest ecosystems in New Zealand could have human health implications. ¬© 2010 International Association for Ecology and Health.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77951023043&doi=10.1007%2fs10393-009-0238-9&partnerID=40&md5=6f0b49f4ddd52e8251ec87ce6864dfd2","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/pubmed.csv",2

The extension and frequency of 11 land cover types surrounding villages were determined using aerial photographs and subsequently verified through field surveys. Elevation was the main landscape feature that separated villages with low and high mosquito abundance. All villages with high mosquito abundance were below 25 m. Transitional and mangrove land cover types were found only in the high mosquito abundance group. Flooded areas as potential breeding sites and potential adult resting sites in unmanaged pastures were significantly more frequent in areas surrounding villages with high mosquito abundance.

The results show that Aedes albopictus aggregates mostly near areas with a human presence and the urban landscape, while Culex pipiens is more spatio-temporally spread, as it can also be found in wilder and less anthropized areas where the availability of human hosts is limited. Culex pipiens is also active earlier in the year. From a microgeographical perspective, our results confirm the anthropophilic spatial distribution of Ae.

The breadth and composition of viral mutant swarms impact viral fitness and adaptation, and the capacity for swarm plasticity is likely to be particularly important for arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) that cycle between taxonomically divergent hosts. Despite this, characterization of the relationship between the selective pressures and genetic signatures of the mutant swarm and consensus sequences is lacking. To clarify this, we analyzed previously generated whole genome, deep-sequencing data from 548 West Nile virus samples isolated from avian tissues or mosquitoes in New York State from 1999‚Äì2018. Both consensus level (interhost) and minority level (intrahost) nucleotide and amino acid sequences were analyzed, and diversity at each position was calculated across the genome in order to assess the relationship between minority and consensus sequences for individual genes and hosts. Our results indicate that consensus sequences are an inept representation of the overall genetic diversity. Unique host and gene-specific signatures and selective pressures were identified. These data demonstrate that an accurate and comprehensive understanding of arbovirus evolution and adaptation within and between hosts requires consideration of minority genotypes. ¬© 2020 by the authors.

The virus circulates in enzootic cycles between multiple species of mosquitoes, wildlife reservoir hosts and humans. Public health concern about RRV is increasing due to rising incidence rates in Australian urban centres, along with increased circulation in Pacific Island countries. Australia experienced its largest recorded outbreak of 9544 cases in 2015, with the majority reported from south east Queensland (SEQ). This study examined potential links between disease patterns and transmission pathways of RRV. Methods: The spatial and temporal distribution of notified RRV cases, and associated epidemiological features in SEQ, were analysed for the period 2001-2016. This included fine-scale analysis of disease patterns across the suburbs of the capital city of Brisbane, and those of 8 adjacent Local Government Areas, and host spot analyses to identify locations with significantly high incidence. Results: The mean annual incidence rate for the region was 41/100,000 with a consistent seasonal peak in cases between February and May. The highest RRV incidence was in adults aged from 30 to 64 years (mean incidence rate: 59/100,000), and females had higher incidence rates than males (mean incidence rates: 44/100,000 and 34/100,000, respectively). Spatial patterns of disease were heterogeneous between years, and there was a wide distribution of disease across both urban and rural areas of SEQ. Overall, the highest incidence rates were reported from predominantly rural suburbs to the north of Brisbane City, with significant hot spots located in peri-urban suburbs where residential, agricultural and conserved natural land use types intersect. Conclusions: Although RRV is endemic across all of SEQ, transmission is most concentrated in areas where urban and peri-urban environments intersect. The drivers of RRV transmission across rural-urban landscapes should be prioritised for further investigation, including identification of specific vectors and hosts that mediate human spillover. ¬© 2020 The Author(s).","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092272231&doi=10.1186%2fs12879-020-05411-x&partnerID=40&md5=46f1412e2bc47e28fc86530830a1f736","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/scopus.ris",1

Parasitism may modulate host species presence and abundance, and parasite effects can change according to forest management practices. Such processes are not well studied in vector-borne avian haemosporidians. We analyzed the effects of forest management on bird-dipteran-haemosporidian interactions, using seven common bird species in managed and unmanaged beech forest habitats in northeastern Germany. We assumed that forest structural heterogeneity affects parasite population parameters in avian hosts (i.e., prevalence and parasitemia), through its effect on the condition of the avian host but also through varying vector abundances. Results: Parasite prevalence was high (about 80%) and homogeneous across different beech forest categories (i.e., young, old, unmanaged) and for all bird species, except Erithacus rubecula (35%). Parasitemia varied across bird species but not across forest categories within each avian species (lowest parasitemia were found in E. rubecula, Turdus merula, and Turdus philomelos). In our study system, we found that vector abundance was not the main driver of parasite dynamics. We found that forest structure affects parasite infection probability directly and potentially host condition via available resources that have to be used either to combat infections (i.e., high parasitemia) or to maintain a good body condition. Conclusions: The effects of each of the predictors were bird species-specific, and we found that Diptera vectors were not the foremost influence in our host-vector-parasite system. Effects of forest habitat variables indicated that for most bird species in this study, habitat regulation of infection probability was more likely (i.e., E. rubecula, Fringilla coelebs, Sylvia atricapilla), whereas for Parus major habitat characteristics impacted first individuals' body condition and subsequently the probability of infection. Our findings emphasize the need of species-specific analyses and to use continuous forest structural parameters (e.g., the proportion of gap, south facing aspect) to better understand habitat and land use effects on host-vector-parasite dynamics. ¬© 2020 The Author(s).","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089714382&doi=10.1186%2fs12898-020-00315-5&partnerID=40&md5=c6a65e5ee92853e4cf561150e3d74b92","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/scopus.ris",1

In the Americas, yellow fever (YF) exhibits only the sylvatic cycle, in which the virus circulates in sylvatic areas among non-human primates, being transmitted by mosquitoes of the Haemagogus and Sabethes genera. In this study, we investigate some aspects of the landscape in relation to diversity and abundance of culicid species associated with YF transmission. Studies were performed in the Cantareira State Park, a remnant of the Atlantic Forest located in Greater Metropolitan S√£o Paulo, Brazil, where the YF virus circulated recently with dozens of deaths in howler monkeys (Alouatta guariba), in addition to reported human cases. Mosquito collections were carried out monthly from February 2015 to April 2017. Mosquitoes were collected from three sites using battery-powered aspirator (12-volt battery), CDC, and Shannon traps for adults, and suction samplers and entomological spoons in breeding sites to collect immature forms. 703 mosquitoes belonging to 12 species of the Aedini and Sabethini tribes were collected. Aedes scapularis and Psorophora ferox exhibited higher abundance, while Haemagogus leucocelaenus, the main vector of YF in S√£o Paulo state, showed lower abundance in all sampled areas. The site with longer edge between forest area and anthropic area presented more richness and abundance of YF vector species, while the site with larger forest cover area and shorter edges between forest and anthropic areas exhibited an inverse pattern. Statistically significant differences were observed between the composition of potential YF vector species among the investigated sites. Although Hg. leucocelaenus occurred in all sampled sites, the different patterns of distribution and abundance of other mosquitoes such as Aedes scapularis and Psorophora ferox suggest that these species may be involved in the transmission of sylvatic YF in the study area. ¬© 2020 Elsevier B.V.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079030691&doi=10.1016%2fj.actatropica.2020.105385&partnerID=40&md5=716b38ba5f2eef608edc260b1328ac32","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/scopus.ris",1

Some aspects of adult mosquito behavior and mosquito ecology play an important role in determining the capacity of vector populations to transmit pathogens. Here, we reexamine factors affecting the transmission of pathogens by mosquitoes using a new approach. Unlike most previous models, this framework considers the behavioral states and state transitions of adult mosquitoes through a sequence of activity bouts. We developed a new framework for individual-based simulation models called MBITES (Mosquito Boutbased and Individual-based Transmission Ecology Simulator). In MBITES, it is possible to build models that simulate the behavior and ecology of adult mosquitoes in exquisite detail on complex resource landscapes generated by spatial point processes. We also developed an ordinary differential equation model which is the Kolmogorov forward equations for models developed in MBITES under a specific set of simplifying assumptions. While mosquito infection and pathogen development are one possible part of a mosquito's state, that is not our main focus. Using extensive simulation using some models developed in MBITES, we show that vectorial capacity can be understood as an emergent property of simple behavioral algorithms interacting with complex resource landscapes, and that relative density or sparsity of resources and the need to search can have profound consequences for mosquito populations' capacity to transmit pathogens. ¬© 2020 Wu et al.

In humans, ZIKV is able to replicate in cell types from different tissues including placental cells, neurons, and microglia. This intricate virus-cell interaction is accompanied by virally induced changes in the infected cell aimed to promote viral replication as well as cellular responses aimed to counteract or tolerate the virus. Early in the infection, the 11-kb positive-sense RNA genome recruit ribosomes in the cytoplasm and the complex is translocated to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for viral protein synthesis. In this process, ZIKV replication is known to induce cellular stress, which triggers both the expression of innate immune genes and the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2Œ±), shutting-off host protein synthesis. Remodeling of the ER during ZIKV replication also triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR), which induces changes in the cellular transcriptional landscapes aimed to tolerate infection or trigger apoptosis. Alternatively, ZIKV replication induces changes in the adenosine methylation patterns of specific host mRNAs, which have different consequences in viral replication and cellular fate. In addition, the ZIKV RNA genome undergoes adenosine methylation by the host machinery, which results in the inhibition of viral replication. However, despite these relevant findings, the full scope of these processes to the outcome of infection remains poorly elucidated. This review summarizes relevant aspects of the complex crosstalk between RNA metabolism and cellular stress responses against ZIKV and discusses their possible impact on viral pathogenesis. ¬© 2020 by the authors.

Many of these diseases are well-known among veterinary practitioners and some of them are called emerging diseases as prevalence, temporal and spatial distribution seem to increase in Europe. The number of newly recognized pathogens, transmitted by a variety of arthropod vectors, that are relevant for dogs and cats, is also increasing every year. The prevalence among infected vectors and hosts is a hot topic in veterinary science throughout the entire continent, as well as the development of efficient diagnostic procedures, therapy and prophylactic measures. Companion animal vector-borne diseases comprise a large group of pathogens including viruses, bacteria, protozoa and helminths. These pathogens are mainly transmitted by bloodsucking arthropods (ticks, fleas, mosquitos, sand flies), and more seldom by direct transmission between vertebrate hosts. Vector prevalence and activity is influenced by local climate conditions, host species density, changes in landscape and land use. Human parameters such as poverty and migration affect the use of prophylactic measures against pathogen transmission and infection as well as increasing the zoonotic risk to introducing pathogens by infected humans. Small animal associated factors such as pet trade and pet travel spread infection and certain vectors such as ticks and fleas. All these factors pose several complex and significant challenges for veterinarians in clinical practice to decide on efficient laboratory work-up and constructive diagnostic procedures. ¬© 2020 Leschnik Michael.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087841003&doi=10.2478%2facve-2020-0011&partnerID=40&md5=1713f6a1819985b42b65b3eb9fdd49ce","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/scopus.ris",1

Recent outbreaks further highlight the substantial public health burden caused by these viruses. Arthritogenic alphaviruses are often reported in the context of focused outbreaks in specific regions (eg, Caribbean, southeast Asia, and Indian Ocean) and cause debilitating acute disease that can extend to chronic manifestations for years after infection. These viruses are classified among several antigenic complexes, span a range of hosts and mosquito vectors, and can be distributed along specific geographical locations. In this Review, we highlight key features of alphaviruses that are known to cause arthritic disease in humans and outline the present findings pertaining to classification, immunogenicity, pathogenesis, and experimental approaches aimed at limiting disease manifestations. Although the most prominent alphavirus outbreaks in the past 15 years featured chikungunya virus, and a large body of work has been dedicated to understanding chikungunya disease mechanisms, this Review will instead focus on other arthritogenic alphaviruses that have been identified globally and provide a comprehensive appraisal of present and future research directions. ¬© 2020 Elsevier Ltd","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096391107&doi=10.1016%2fS1473-3099%2820%2930491-6&partnerID=40&md5=1987f69baf02200220060c5ca8d5cbdb","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/scopus.ris",1

Macrophages are a type of pivotal innate immunocyte that serve as sentinels and respond quickly to pathogen invasions. However, some viruses like JEV can hijack macrophages as a refuge for viral replication and immune escape. Despite their crucial involvement in early JEV infection, the transcriptomic landscapes of JEV-infected macrophages are void. Here, by using an in situ JEV infection model, we investigate the transcriptomic alteration of JEV-infected peritoneal macrophages. We found that, upon JEV infection, the macrophages underwent M1 polarization and showed the drastic activation of innate immune and inflammatory pathways. Interestingly, almost all the programmed cell death (PCD) pathways were activated, especially the apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis pathways, which were verified by the immunofluorescent staining of specific markers. Further transcriptomic analysis and TUNEL staining revealed that JEV infection caused apparent DNA damage. The transcriptomic analysis also revealed that JEV infection promoted ROS and RNS generation and caused oxidative stress, which activated multiple cell death pathways.

Because of the spatial and temporal scales at which parasites are transported by their hosts, malaria sub-populations are largely defined by mosquito movement and malaria connectivity among them is largely driven by human movement. Characterising malaria connectivity thus requires characterising human travel between areas with differing levels of exposure to malaria. Whilst understanding malaria connectivity is fundamental for optimising interventions, particularly in areas seeking or sustaining elimination, there is a dearth of human movement data required to achieve this goal. Malaria indicator surveys (MIS) are a generally under utilised but potentially rich source of travel data that provide a unique opportunity to study simple associations between malaria infection and human travel in large population samples. This paper shares the experience working with MIS data from Bioko Island that revealed programmatically useful information regarding malaria importation through human travel. Simple additions to MIS questionnaires greatly augmented the level of detail of the travel data, which can be used to characterise human travel patterns and malaria connectivity to assist targeting interventions. It is argued that MIS potentially represent very important and timely sources of travel data that need to be further exploited. ¬© 2019 The Author(s).","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077086352&doi=10.1186%2fs12936-019-3078-2&partnerID=40&md5=c88ff9034742c446bc0f7b8060f454d3","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/scopus.ris",1

In that time, WNV has crossed the continent and established enzootic transmission cycles, resulting in intermittent outbreaks of human disease that have largely been linked with climatic variables and waning avian seroprevalence. During the transcontinental dissemination of WNV, the original genotype has been displaced by two principal extant genotypes which contain an envelope mutation that has been associated with enhanced vector competence by Culex pipiens L. (Diptera: Culicidae) and Culex tarsalis Coquillett vectors. Analyses of retrospective avian host competence data generated using the founding NY99 genotype strain have demonstrated a steady reduction in viremias of house sparrows over time. Reciprocally, the current genotype strains WN02 and SW03 have demonstrated an inverse correlation between house sparrow viremia magnitude and the time since isolation. These data collectively indicate that WNV has evolved for increased avian viremia while house sparrows have evolved resistance to the virus such that the relative host competence has remained constant. Intrahost analyses of WNV evolution demonstrate that selection pressures are avian species-specific and purifying selection is greater in individual birds compared with individual mosquitoes, suggesting that the avian adaptive and/or innate immune response may impose a selection pressure on WNV. Phylogenomic, experimental evolutionary systems, and models that link viral evolution with climate, host, and vector competence studies will be needed to identify the relative effect of different selective and stochastic mechanisms on viral phenotypes and the capacity of newly evolved WNV genotypes for transmission in continuously changing landscapes. ¬© 2019 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Entomological Society of America.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074308746&doi=10.1093%2fjme%2ftjz112&partnerID=40&md5=33e2d2ad4e5829aaf1a14f4ebb8b3b08","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/scopus.ris",1

This hypothesis is largely based on suspected higher rates of zoonotic disease spillover and emergence in fragmented landscapes and other areas where humans live in close vicinity to wildlife. For example, Ebola virus outbreaks have been linked to contacts between humans and infected wildlife at the rural-forest border, and spillover of yellow fever via mosquito vectors happens at the interface between forest and human settlements. Because spillover involves complex interactions between multiple species and is difficult to observe directly, empirical studies are scarce, particularly those that quantify underlying mechanisms. In this review, we identify and explore potential ecological mechanisms affecting spillover of pathogens (and parasites in general) at ecosystem boundaries. We borrow the concept of 'permeability' from animal movement ecology as a measure of the likelihood that hosts and parasites are present in an ecosystem boundary region. We then discuss how different mechanisms operating at the levels of organisms and ecosystems might affect permeability and spillover. This review is a step towards developing a general theory of cross-species parasite spillover across ecosystem boundaries with the eventual aim of improving predictions of spillover risk in heterogeneous landscapes.

To survive such hostile and shifting conditions, Plasmodium switches transcriptional programs during development and has evolved mechanisms to adjust its phenotype through heterogeneous patterns of gene expression. In vitro studies on culture-adapted isolates have served to set the link between chromatin structure and functional gene expression. Yet, experimental evidence is limited to certain stages of the parasite in the vertebrate, i.e. blood, while the precise mechanisms underlying the dynamic regulatory landscapes during development and in the adaptation to within-host conditions remain poorly understood. In this review, we discuss available data on transcriptional and epigenetic regulation in Plasmodium mosquito stages in the context of sporogonic development and phenotypic variation, including both bet-hedging and environmentally triggered direct transcriptional responses. With this, we advocate the mosquito offers an in vivo biological model to investigate the regulatory networks, transcription factors and chromatin-modifying enzymes and their modes of interaction with regulatory sequences, which might be responsible for the plasticity of the Plasmodium genome that dictates stage- and cell type-specific blueprints of gene expression. ¬© 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

Wolbachia infections inhibit viral transmission by the mosquito, and can spread between mosquito hosts to reach high frequencies in the vector population. Wolbachia spreads by maternal transmission, and spread dynamics can be variable and highly dependent on natural mosquito population dynamics, population structure and fitness components. We develop a mathematical model of an A. aegypti metapopulation that incorporates empirically validated relationships describing density-dependent mosquito fitness components. We assume that density dependent relationships differ across subpopulations, and construct heterogeneous landscapes for which model-predicted patterns of variation in mosquito abundance and demography approximate those observed in field populations. We then simulate Wolbachia release strategies similar to that used in field trials. We show that our model can produce rates of spatial spread of Wolbachia similar to those observed following field releases. We then investigate how different types of spatio-temporal variation in mosquito habitat, as well as different fitness costs incurred by Wolbachia on the mosquito host, influence predicted spread rates. We find that fitness costs reduce spread rates more strongly when the habitat landscape varies temporally due to stochastic and seasonal processes. Synthesis and applications: Our empirically based modelling approach represents effects of environmental heterogeneity on the spatial spread of Wolbachia. The models can assist in interpreting observed spread patterns following field releases and in designing suitable release strategies for targeting spatially heterogeneous vector populations. ¬© 2019 The Authors.

In some urban areas, this expansion has resulted in this invasive species being elevated as an important vector of dengue virus. Ornamental plants are often a feature of the urban landscape that may provide harborage for mosquitoes. Because adult mosquitoes require carbohydrates for subsistence, landscape vegetation may provide natural sugar sources to meet those needs. The aim of our study was to determine whether feeding on different ornamental plants from urban areas affects the survivorship and fecundity of Ae. albopictus. Newly emerged mosquitoes were given access to 11 ornamental plant species (6 flowering, 5 nonflowering) as sugar sources under laboratory conditions. Generally, survivorship was greater significantly when mosquitoes fed upon the ornamentals compared with those that were offered only water, whereas survivorship was shortened when individuals fed only on sucrose (P < 0.05). Mosquitoes that fed on nonflowering plants laid fewer eggs compared with those exposed to flowering plants. No significant difference was observed in egg hatch from females feeding on any of the plant species. Our findings provide insight into the potential influence that urban ornamental plants may have on the ecology of adult Ae. albopictus. The results of this study provide new avenues for integrated mosquito management in urban landscaped areas by planting ornamental plant species that contribute to lower survivorship and fecundity of peridomestically produced mosquitoes. ¬© 2019 Florida Entomological Society.

On the microevolutionary context, it comparatively discusses the current knowledge on the population genetics of representatives of the genera Aedes, Anopheles and Culex, and comments on insecticide resistance of culicids. It also discusses other biological aspects of culicids that are not usually addressed in microevolutionary studies, such as vectorial competence, endosymbiosis, and wing morphology. One conclusion is that mosquitoes are highly genetically variable, adaptable, fast evolving, and have versatile vectorial competence. Unveiling microevolutionary patterns is fundamental for the design and maintenance of all control programs. Sampling methods for assessing microevolution must be standardized and must follow meaningful guidelines, such as those of ‚Äúlandscape genetics‚Äù. A good understanding of microevolution requires more than a collection of case studies on population genetics and resistance. Future research could deal not only with the microevolution sensu stricto, but also with evolutionarily meaningful issues, such as inheritable characters, epigenetics, physiological cost-free plasticity, vector immunity, symbiosis, pathogen-mosquito co-evolution and environmental variables. A genotyping panel for seeking adaptive phenotypes as part of the standardization of population genetics methods is proposed. The investigative paradigm should not only be retrospective but also prospective, despite the unpredictability of evolution.

This mosquito-borne arbovirus is also a zoonosis, making its epidemiology and infection ecology complex and cryptic. Our grasp of enzootic, epizootic, and zoonotic RRV transmission dynamics is imprecise largely due to a poor understanding of the role of wild mammalian hosts in the RRV system. Methods: The current study applied a piecewise structural equation model (PSEM) toward an interspecific comparison of sylvatic Australian mammals to characterize the ecological and life history profile of species with a history of RRV infection relative to those species with no such history among all wild mammalian species surveyed for RRV infection. The effects of species traits were assessed through multiple causal pathways within the PSEM framework. Results: Sylvatic mammalian species with a history of RRV infection tended to express dietary specialization and smaller population density. These species were also characterized by a longer gestation length. Conclusions: This study provides the first interspecific comparison of wild mammals for RRV infection and identifies some potential targets for future wildlife surveys into the infection ecology of this important arbovirus. An applied RRV macroecology may prove invaluable to the epidemiological modeling of RRV epidemics across diverse sylvatic landscapes, as well as to the development of human and animal health surveillance systems. ¬© 2019 The Author(s).","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85059947551&doi=10.1186%2fs12898-019-0220-5&partnerID=40&md5=32af0e7bec93f19ad501815b21681522","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/scopus.ris",1

Diseases such as malaria and bilharzia require intermediate hosts that propagate in aquatic environments, like rice paddies, and often the interaction of the intermediate hosts with the environment influences the transmission of the pathogens. Irrigation is needed for the farming of rice and other crops but also creates suitable conditions for mosquito and snail breeding and is a risk factor for malaria and schistosomiasis transmission. Rural communities in developing nations of sub-Saharan Africa that work in rice irrigation systems are faced with the risks of infection from malaria and bilharzia owing to poor environmental sanitation. The lack of safe drinking water and the nonmechanized nature of rice farming promote schistosomiasis and geohelminth infection. In addition to many of these sub-Saharan countries, the lack of adequate facilities and medicines for treatment increases the risk of infection with these pathogens. Although control measures are available to prevent transmission, they are not used effectively due to a variety of reasons, including the lack of proper public health and medical infrastructure. ¬© 2019 Elsevier B.V.

WNV cycles in nature between mosquito vectors and birds that act as amplifier hosts and play an essential role in virus ecology, being, thus, WNV a threat to many species. Availability of an efficient avian vaccine would benefit certain avian populations, both birds grown for hunting and restocking activities, as well as endangered species in captive breeding projects, wildlife reservations, and recreation installations, and would be useful to prevent and contain outbreaks. Avian vaccination would be also of interest to limit WNV spillover to humans or horses from susceptible bird species that live in urbanized landscapes, like magpies. Herein, we have addressed the efficacy of a single dose of a WNV recombinant subviral particle (RSP) vaccine in susceptible magpie (Pica pica). The protective capacity of the RSP-based vaccine was demonstrated upon challenge of magpies with 5 √ó 103 plaque forming units of a neurovirulent WNV strain. A significant improvement in survival rates of immunized birds was recorded when compared to vehicle-inoculated animals (71.4 vs. 22.2%, respectively). Viremia, which is directly related to the capacity of a host to be competent for virus transmission, was reduced in vaccinated animals, as was the presence of infectious virus in feather follicles. Bird-to-bird transmission was recorded in three of six unchallenged (contact) magpies housed with non-vaccinated WNV-infected birds, but not in contact animals housed with vaccinated WNV-infected magpies. These results demonstrate the protective efficacy of the RSP-based vaccine in susceptible birds against WNV infection and its value in controlling the spread of the virus. ¬© 2019 Frontiers Media S.A.

The feeding biology of the most important malaria vectors in the region, notably Nyssorhynchus darlingi, compounds efforts to control vectors and reduce transmission of what has become known as ""Frontier Malaria"". Exploring Anophelinae mosquito diversity is fundamental to understanding the species responsible for transmission and developing appropriate management and intervention strategies for malaria control in the Amazon River basin. Methods: This study describes Anophelinae mosquito diversity from settler communities affected by Frontier Malaria in the states of Acre, Amazonas and Rond√¥nia by analysing COI gene data using cluster and tree-based species delimitation approaches. Results: In total, 270 specimens from collection sites were sequenced and these were combined with 151 reference (GenBank) sequences in the analysis to assist in species identification. Conservative estimates found that the number of species collected at these sites was between 23 (mPTP partition) and 27 (strict ABGD partition) species, up to 13 of which appeared to be new. Nyssorhynchus triannulatus and Nyssorhynchus braziliensis displayed exceptional levels of intraspecific genetic diversity but there was little to no support for putative species complex status. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that Anophelinae mosquito diversity continues to be underestimated in poorly sampled areas where frontier malaria is a major public health concern. The findings will help shape future studies of vector incrimination and transmission dynamics in these areas and support efforts to develop more effective vector control and transmission reduction strategies in settler communities in the Amazon River basin. ¬© 2018 The Author(s).","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054102933&doi=10.1186%2fs12936-018-2483-2&partnerID=40&md5=b2e66834afa8b86576debce60069e2dc","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/scopus.ris",1

These effects can significantly impact farmland irrigation, water transportation, and human health. However, methods for controlling its growth are not ideal, and control using biological and chemical agents can result in secondary pollution. The utilization of E. crassipes as a resource, for example, as animal feed or organic substrates, can not only turn waste into valuable resources, but it can also solve the problem of its growth, thus bringing about economic and ecological benefits. In this paper, the growth and ecological characteristics of E. crassipes, its nutrient composition, and resource utilization approaches were reviewed. The challenges associated with the large-scale utilization of E. crassipes were also analyzed in order to provide references for the control and resource utilization of the species. Regarding challenges such as the difficulty of cultivation and the high cost of harvesting and dehydrating, it is necessary to investigate the proper water surface and coverage characteristics of E. crassipes cultivation to assure adequate biomass and protect the ecological landscape. It is also necessary to evaluate the effect of E. crassipes cultivation on the health of aquatic ecosystems and the safety of the water environment in order to prevent the significant potential ecological and environmental risks.

Compartmental models, which focus on interactions and transitions between population strata, have been a mainstay of such modelling for more than a century. However, modellers are increasingly adopting agent-based approaches, which model hosts, vectors and/or their interactions on an individual level. One reason for the increasing popularity of such models is their potential to provide enhanced realism by allowing system-level behaviours to emerge as a consequence of accumulated individual-level interactions, as occurs in real populations. Methods: A systematic review of 90 articles published between 1998 and May 2018 was performed, characterizing agent-based models (ABMs) relevant to malaria transmission. The review provides an overview of approaches used to date, determines the advantages of these approaches, and proposes ideas for progressing the field. Results: The rationale for ABM use over other modelling approaches centres around three points: the need to accurately represent increased stochasticity in low-transmission settings; the benefits of high-resolution spatial simulations; and heterogeneities in drug and vaccine efficacies due to individual patient characteristics. The success of these approaches provides avenues for further exploration of agent-based techniques for modelling malaria transmission. Potential extensions include varying elimination strategies across spatial landscapes, extending the size of spatial models, incorporating human movement dynamics, and developing increasingly comprehensive parameter estimation and optimization techniques. Conclusion: Collectively, the literature covers an extensive array of topics, including the full spectrum of transmission and intervention regimes. Bringing these elements together under a common framework may enhance knowledge of, and guide policies towards, malaria elimination. However, because of the diversity of available models, endorsing a standardized approach to ABM implementation may not be possible. Instead it is recommended that model frameworks be contextually appropriate and sufficiently described. One key recommendation is to develop enhanced parameter estimation and optimization techniques. Extensions of current techniques will provide the robust results required to enhance current elimination efforts. ¬© 2018 The Author(s).","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85051747278&doi=10.1186%2fs12936-018-2442-y&partnerID=40&md5=0d12e09f537c6cd61ae126c5fd8a92b8","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/scopus.ris",1

Classical coupled vector - human models typically assume that mosquito abundance is either independent from, or proportional to, human population density, implying a decreasing force of infection, or per capita infection rate with host number. We question these assumptions by introducing an explicit dependence between host and vector densities through different recruitment functions, whose dynamical consequences we examine in a modified model formulation. Contrasting patterns in the force of infection are demonstrated, including in particular increasing trends when recruitment grows sufficiently fast with human density. Interaction of these patterns with seasonality in temperature can give rise to pronounced differences in timing, relative peak sizes, and duration of epidemics. These proposed dependencies explain empirical dengue risk patterns observed in the city of Delhi where socioeconomic status has an impact on both human and mosquito densities. These observed risk trends with host density are inconsistent with current standard models. A better understanding of the connection between vector recruitment and host density is needed to address the population dynamics of mosquito-transmitted infections in urban landscapes. ¬© 2018 The Authors.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85052657807&doi=10.1098%2frspb.2018.0826&partnerID=40&md5=56684b0ee689ee2c1345340d8290a394","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/scopus.ris",1

We monitored two cohorts of 15 pigs and determined the force of infection‚Äìrate at which seronegative pigs become positive‚Äìin two study farms located in a peri-urban and rural area, respectively. We also studied the mosquito abundance and diversity in proximity of the pigs, as well as the host densities in both areas. All the pigs seroconverted before the age of 6 months. The force of infection was 0.061 per day (95% confidence interval = 0.034‚Äì0.098) in the peri-urban cohort and 0.069 per day (95% confidence interval = 0.047‚Äì0.099) in the rural cohort. Several differences in the epidemiologic dynamic of Japanese encephalitis between both study sites were highlighted. The later virus amplification in the rural cohort may be linked to the later waning of maternal antibodies, but also to the higher pig density in direct proximity of the studied pigs, which could have led to a dilution of mosquito bites at the farm level. The force of infection was almost identical in both the peri-urban and the rural farms studied, which shifts the classic epidemiologic cycle of the virus.

But this was a landscape where dangers lurked not only in the unstable ground but also in the air, where it was considered that the miasmic vapors laid low even the locals with the ague or marsh fever that had popularly begun to be called after the Italian ""bad air"" (mal-aria), or malaria. Together water and air defined the English Lowlands as separate and apart from the rest of the country. However, this was also a changing environment, one that underwent a profound transformation as the land was drained and its soils made arable. As the water receded, so too did the incidence of Plasmodium vivax.

Subsequently the virus jumped out of this ancestral cycle into a human-endemic transmission cycle vectored by anthropophilic mosquitoes. Sylvatic CHIKV cycles persist in Africa and continue to spill over into humans, creating the potential for new CHIKV strains to enter human-endemic transmission. To mitigate such spillover, it is first necessary to delineate the distributions of the sylvatic mosquito vectors of CHIKV, to identify the environmental factors that shape these distributions, and to determine the association of mosquito presence with key drivers of virus spillover, including mosquito and CHIKV abundance. We therefore modeled the distribution of seven CHIKV mosquito vectors over two sequential rainy seasons in K√©dougou, Senegal using Maxent. Methods: Mosquito data were collected in fifty sites distributed in five land cover classes across the study area. Environmental data representing land cover, topographic, and climatic factors were included in the models. Models were compared and evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) statistics. The correlation of model outputs with abundance of individual mosquito species as well as CHIKV-positive mosquito pools was tested. Results: Fourteen models were produced and evaluated; the environmental variables most strongly associated with mosquito distributions were distance to large patches of forest, landscape patch size, rainfall, and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Seven models were positively correlated with mosquito abundance and one (Aedes taylori) was consistently, positively correlated with CHIKV-positive mosquito pools. Eight models predicted high relative occurrence rates of mosquitoes near the villages of Tenkoto and Ngary, the areas with the highest frequency of CHIKV-positive mosquito pools. Conclusions: Of the environmental factors considered here, landscape fragmentation and configuration had the strongest influence on mosquito distributions. Of the mosquito species modeled, the distribution of Ae. taylori correlated most strongly with abundance of CHIKV, suggesting that presence of this species will be a useful predictor of sylvatic CHIKV presence. ¬© 2018 The Author(s).","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85045691783&doi=10.1186%2fs13071-018-2832-6&partnerID=40&md5=771f74710f56bd0578c24cb1ed238faf","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/scopus.ris",1

Rapid global expansion of previously obscure pathogens, such as Zika and chikungunya viruses in recent years highlights the importance of understanding how anthropogenic changes influence emergence and spillover of vector-borne diseases. Deforestation has been identified as one anthropogenic change that influences vector-borne disease prevalence, although contrasting pictures of the effects of deforestation on vector-borne disease transmission have been reported. These conflicting findings are likely attributable to the inherent complexity of vector-borne disease systems, which involve diverse groups of vectors, hosts and pathogens, depending on geography. The current study represents a quantitative exploration of the link between deforestation and mosquitoes, the most important common constituents of vector-borne disease systems. Analysis of data compiled from published field studies for 87 mosquito species from 12 countries revealed that about half of the species (52.9%) were associated with deforested habitats. Of these species that are favored by deforestation, a much larger percentage (56.5%) are confirmed vectors of human pathogens, compared to those negatively impacted by deforestation (27.5%). Moreover, species that serve as vectors of multiple human pathogens were all favored by deforestation, including Anopheles bancroftii, Anopheles darlingi, Anopheles farauti, Anopheles funestus s.l., Anopheles gambiae s.l., Anopheles subpictus, Aedes aegypti, Aedes vigilax, Culex annulirostris, and Culex quinquefasciatus. Our quantitative analysis of vector and non-vector species, demonstrates that the net effect of deforestation favors mosquitoes that serve as vectors of human disease, while the obverse holds true for non-vectors species. These results begin to unify our understanding of the relationship between deforestation and vector mosquitoes, an important step in quantifying how land use change, specifically deforestation, affects human risk of vector-borne disease. ¬© 2017 Gesellschaft f√ºr √ñkologie","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85031415347&doi=10.1016%2fj.baae.2017.09.012&partnerID=40&md5=c4081f9dcf0d3b8168dcb927c2660379","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/scopus.ris",1

For example, microbial symbionts can impact mosquito reproduction, survival, and vectorial capacity, and hence affect disease transmission. Nonetheless, current knowledge of mosquito-associated microbial communities is limited. To characterize the bacterial and eukaryotic microbial communities of multiple vector species collected from different habitat types in disease endemic areas, we employed next-generation 454 pyrosequencing of 16S and 18S rRNA amplicon libraries, also known as metabarcoding. We investigated pooled whole adult mosquitoes of three medically important vectors, Aedes aegypti, Ae.¬ albopictus, and Culex quinquefasciatus, collected from different habitats across central Thailand where we previously characterized mosquito diversity. Our results indicate that diversity within the mosquito microbiota is low, with the majority of microbes assigned to one or a few taxa. Two of the most common eukaryotic and bacterial genera recovered (Ascogregarina and Wolbachia, respectively) are known mosquito endosymbionts with potentially parasitic and long evolutionary relationships with their hosts. Patterns of microbial composition and diversity appeared to differ by both vector species and habitat for a given species, although high variability between samples suggests a strong stochastic element to microbiota assembly. In general, our findings suggest that multiple factors, such as habitat condition and mosquito species identity, may influence overall microbial community composition, and thus provide a basis for further investigations into the interactions between vectors, their microbial communities, and human-impacted landscapes that may ultimately affect vector-borne disease risk. ¬© 2017 The Authors.

In order to anticipate and prevent possible epidemiological spread of flaviviruses in humans and domestic animals, the ecology of their transmission in the oasis system needs to be better understood. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the seroprevalence of anti-flavivirus antibodies in the laughing dove (Spilopelia senegalensis), an abundant resident bird in Tunisian oases. Anti-flavivirus antibodies were detected in 17% of sampled doves. Ten per cent of the total tested doves were West Nile virus (WNV) seropositive and 4% were Usutu virus (USUV) seropositive, which provides the first evidence of USUV circulation in Tunisian birds. We also found that the occurrence probability of anti-flavivirus antibodies in dove plasma increased with decreasing distance to coast, suggesting that doves inhabiting coastal oases were more exposed to flaviviruses compared with those inhabiting inland oases. We also found significantly higher antibody occurrence probability in adult doves compared with young doves, which underlines the effect of exposure time. Overall, our results suggest that the laughing dove may be used for WNV and USUV surveillance in southern Tunisia. They also stress the need for investigations combining data on birds and mosquitoes to better understand the ecological factors governing the circulation of flaviviruses in this area.

Spatial heterogeneity of mosquito resources, such as hosts and breeding sites, affects mosquito dispersal behavior. This paper analyzes and simulates the spreading of anopheles mosquito on a complex metapopulation, that is, networks of populations connected by migratory flows whose configurations are described in terms of connectivity distribution of nodes (patches) and the conditional probabilities of connections between nodes. We examine the impacts of vector dispersal on the persistence and extinction of a mosquito population in both homogeneous and heterogeneous landscapes. For uncorrelated networks in a homogeneous landscape, we derive an explicit formula of the basic offspring number R0(m). Using the theory of monotone operators, we obtain sufficient conditions for the global asymptotic stability of equilibria. Precisely, the value 1 of the basic offspring number is a forward bifurcation for the dynamics of anopheles mosquito, with the trivial (mosquito-free) equilibrium point being globally asymptotically stable (GAS) when R0(m)‚â§1, and one stable nontrivial (mosquito-persistent) equilibrium point being born with well determined basins of attraction when R0(m)&gt;1.

Bats in farmland are crucial predators of crop pests, thus offering an economically important ecosystem service. It seems possible that bats may also provide services by feeding on insects associated with livestock. We tested whether bats forage over cattle in a traditionally managed pastoral area of central Italy, i.e. setting the bases for providing pest control services. We found that small bat species (mostly Pipistrellus spp.) foraged preferentially over livestock, and that their activity increased, but then reached a plateau or slightly decreased, for progressively larger herds. Landscape complexity also led to an increase in bat activity over livestock. Since insects attracted to cattle at night typically include flies such as mosquitoes (Culicidae) and biting midges (Ceratopogonidae), which are potentially harmful to cattle and may carry serious diseases, and that bats such as Pipistrellus spp. are important predators of such flies, we argue that bats may play a valuable pest-suppression role. ¬© 2017 Elsevier B.V.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85014682021&doi=10.1016%2fj.agee.2017.03.001&partnerID=40&md5=1f24db742c546141efce3946fd1f3902","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/scopus.ris",1

However, the roles that ecological interactions play in shaping the sequence of species phenologies through a season are largely unexplored. Across the tundra on the Hudson Bay Lowlands, extensive foraging by lesser snow goose populations has been driving alterations to the landscape. Here, I show that this widespread and dramatic disturbance increases evaporation rates of ephemeral ponds and consequently constricts the temporal availability of seasonal aquatic habitats for larval mosquitoes. I also show that this constriction decreases the temporal diversity of closely related univoltine mosquito species that have varying emergence schedules. Three species of mosquitoes emerged through the season from four sampled ephemeral ponds associated with no goose grubbing; only one species emerged, early in the season, from the four ponds that experienced heavy grubbing. This study demonstrates a mechanism for temporal composition change in a ubiquitous and abundant group of arthropods on the tundra. It does not show life history evolution of emergence time of mosquitoes; however, it highlights the rather unexplored role of ecological interactions in altering the diversity of phenologies across seasonal time. ¬© 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84976632196&doi=10.1007%2fs00300-016-1978-y&partnerID=40&md5=7cbd1c0ee15b6c8031e5d0b3076ce9fc","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/scopus.ris",1

They are globally widespread, infecting a large variety of terrestrial animals, birds, insects and even fish. Moreover, they are capable of surviving and circulating in both sylvatic and urban environments, causing considerable human morbidity and mortality. The re-emergence of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in almost every part of the world has caused alarm to many health agencies throughout the world. The mosquito vector for this virus, Aedes, is globally distributed in tropical and temperate regions and capable of thriving in both rural and urban landscapes, giving the opportunity for CHIKV to continue expanding into new geographical regions. Despite the importance of alphaviruses as human pathogens, there is currently no targeted antiviral treatment available for alphavirus infection. This mini-review discusses some of the major features in the replication cycle of alphaviruses, highlighting the key viral targets and host components that participate in alphavirus replication and the molecular functions that were used in drug design. Together with describing the importance of these targets, we review the various direct-acting and host-targeting inhibitors, specifically small molecules that have been discovered and developed as potential therapeutics as well as their reported in vitro and in vivo efficacies. ¬© The Author 2017.

In freshwater systems, fish can dominate sorting both at the colonization and post-colonization stage. Specifically, for many colonizing species, fish can have non-lethal, direct effects that exceed the lethal direct effects of predation. Functionally diverse fish species with a range of predatory capabilities have previously been observed to elicit functionally equivalent responses on oviposition in tree frogs. We tested this hypothesis of functional equivalence of non-lethal effects for four predatory fish species, using naturally colonizing populations of aquatic beetles. Among taxa other than mosquitoes, and with the exception of the chemically camouflaged pirate perch, Aphredoderus sayanus, we provide the first evidence of variation in colonization or oviposition responses to different fish species. Focusing on total abundance, Fundulus chrysotus, a gape-limited, surface-feeding fish, elicited unique responses among colonizing Hydrophilidae, with the exception of the smallest and most abundant taxa, Paracymus, while Dytiscidae responded similarly to all avoided fish. Neither family responded to A. sayanus. Analysis of species richness and multivariate characterization of the beetle assemblages for the four fish species and controls revealed additional variation among the three avoided species and confirmed that chemical camouflage in A. sayanus results in assemblages essentially identical to fishless controls. The origin of this variation in beetle responses to different fish is unknown, but may involve variation in cue sensitivity, different behavioral algorithms, or differential responses to species-specific fish cues. The identity of fish species occupying aquatic habitats is crucial to understanding community structure, as varying strengths of lethal and non-lethal effects, as well as their interaction, create complex landscapes of predator effects and challenge the notion of functional equivalence. ¬© 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85000843980&doi=10.1002%2fecy.1593&partnerID=40&md5=16e930577f21c31d14e4b0b67f6937aa","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/scopus.ris",1

This paper provides the context, activities, progress, and possible contributions toward malaria elimination in the Aseer region since 2000, with a more detailed analysis of the spatial location of locally acquired case incidence since 2012. Methods: This is a descriptive study of all available Ministry of Health surveillance data and process reports since 2000, with higher spatial resolution analysis of data between 2012 and 2015. Results: In 2000, there were 511 cases of Plasmodium falciparum locally acquired infection. The following 4 years witnessed a dramatic decline in cases to only 18 locally acquired infections reported in 2005. A resurgence in local infections was reported in 2006 (93) and 2007 (165), thereafter (2008-2014) local cases continued to decline to fewer than 40 per year across the region. However, in 2015, a small rise was noted (51). All locally acquired infections were P. falciparum. There has been a constant flow of imported infections into Aseer since 2000, mostly among immigrant labour from Pakistan, India, Sudan, and Yemen. Imported infections have included both Plasmodium vivax and P. falciparum. The spatial extent of malaria appears to be changing, but there remain two intractable areas Sarat Abeda and Dhran Aljanub, where risks per reporting centre have changed little since 2001, remaining above 0.5 per 10,000 population. Only seven villages contributed 55% of all locally acquired infection since 2012. Discussion: Aseer has reached a state of very low incidence of locally acquired infections, despite a constant source of imported infections from outside the country. How many of the local infections are F2 generations from imported infections or how many are a result of residual active transmission between asymptomatic carriers of infections transmitted by pockets of existing Anopheles arabiensis populations remains unknown. A more detailed investigation of the spatial and temporal patterns of infected hosts, parasites and vectors would help define whether this region has managed to effectively prevent local transmission of new infections. ¬© 2016 The Author(s).","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84994210519&doi=10.1186%2fs12936-016-1581-2&partnerID=40&md5=0a527e845d87920dc2aa3bb7dabe7bd9","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/scopus.ris",1

Such changes can subsequently affect biological mechanisms of disease emergence including: altered vector breeding sites or reservoir host distribution; niche invasions or interspecies host transfers; changes in biodiversity (including loss of predator species and changes in host population density); human-induced genetic changes of disease vectors or pathogens (such as mosquito resistance to pesticides or the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria); and environmental contamination of infectious disease agents. ¬© 2008 Copyright ¬© 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Accurate models of optimal foraging behaviour should acknowledge the extent to which animals can detect and regulate their intake of food based on smaller scale differences in food types. In particular, consideration of macro-nutrient distribution and how animals perceive this is limited in studies of optimal foraging, particularly in vertebrates and for animals that forage in groups. Here, we track shoals of eight mosquitofish as they forage in two environments that contain equal amounts of available energy but differ in their distribution of macro-nutrients. We provide empirical evidence that fish will distribute themselves within an environment in relation to the distribution of specific macro-nutrients. Also, fish make foraging decisions based on the macronutrient composition of patches, such that their durations on patches are longer when they have a higher concentration of protein and lower concentration of carbohydrate. The ratio of protein to carbohydrate does not affect the probability of a fish joining a patch, however, with low numbers of fish on the patch the probability of a fish leaving is greater per unit time step in the patches with a low protein to carbohydrate ratio than the patches with a high protein to carbohydrate ratio. This study confirms the importance of considering the macro-nutrient composition of foods when considering the movement decisions of foraging groups and thus has important consequences for developing more accurate foraging models that take into account the distribution of macro-nutrients in the environment. The results suggest the spatial distribution of nutrients on a landscape scale could influence grouping patterns and social interactions, thus affecting population dynamics. ¬© 2016 The Authors.

These may vary between species or within a single species depending on the environment. They may be estimated by examination of the ovaries of host-seeking mosquitoes. Methods: Landing collections, Furvela tent-trap and CDC light-trap collections were undertaken sequentially in four locations in Cambodia between February 2012 and December 2013 and samples from the collected mosquitoes were dissected to determine parity, sac stage (indicative of time spent prior to returning to feed) and egg stage. Results: A total of 27,876 Anopheles from 15 species or species groups were collected in the four locations and 2883 specimens were dissected. Both the density and predominant species collected varied according to location and trapping method. Five species were dissected in sufficient numbers to allow comparisons between locations. Estimated oviposition interval differed markedly between species but less within species among different locations. Anopheles aconitus had the shortest cycle, which was 3.17 days (95 % CI 3-3.64), and Anopheles barbirostris had the longest cycle, which took four days (95 % CI 3.29-4). Anopheles minimus had a higher sac rate in weeks leading up to a full moon but there was apparently little effect of moon phase on Anopheles dirus. Despite the fact that many of the species occurred at very low densities, there was no evidence of gonotrophic dissociation in any of them, even during sustained hot, dry periods. The principal Cambodian malaria vector, An. dirus, was only common in one location where it was collected in miniature light-traps inside houses. It did not appear to have an exceptional survival rate (as judged by the low average parous rate) or oviposition cycle. Conclusions: Differences in the oviposition interval were more pronounced among species within locations than within species among ecologically diverse locations. A nationwide survey using CDC light-traps for the collection of An. dirus inside houses may help in determining patterns of malaria transmission in Cambodia. ¬© 2016 The Author(s).","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84978240340&doi=10.1186%2fs12936-016-1389-0&partnerID=40&md5=fcec71e49861f87b8e91b17adde0962e","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/scopus.ris",1

These diseases appear to be increasing as a result of the novel juxtapositions of habitats and species that can result in new interchanges of vectors, diseases and hosts. We studied whether the mosquito community structure varied between habitats and seasons and whether known disease vectors displayed habitat preferences in tropical Australia. Methods: Using CDC model 512 traps, adult mosquitoes were sampled across an anthropogenic disturbance gradient of grassland, rainforest edge and rainforest interior habitats, in both the wet and dry seasons. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS) ordinations were applied to examine major gradients in the composition of mosquito and vector communities. Results: We captured ‚àº13,000 mosquitoes from 288 trap nights across four study sites. A community analysis identified 29 species from 7 genera. Even though mosquito abundance and richness were similar between the three habitats, the community composition varied significantly in response to habitat type. The mosquito community in rainforest interiors was distinctly different to the community in grasslands, whereas forest edges acted as an ecotone with shared communities from both forest interiors and grasslands. We found two community patterns that will influence disease risk at out study sites, first, that disease vectoring mosquito species occurred all year round. Secondly, that anthropogenic grasslands adjacent to rainforests may increase the probability of novel disease transmission through changes to the vector community on rainforest edges, as most disease transmitting species predominantly occurred in grasslands. Conclusion: Our results indicate that the strong influence of anthropogenic land use change on mosquito communities could have potential implications for pathogen transmission to humans and wildlife. ¬© 2016 The Author(s).","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84977272597&doi=10.1186%2fs13071-016-1675-2&partnerID=40&md5=6b2dbeb9c50b48cf88cc79d8071d5014","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/scopus.ris",1

Vector-borne diseases, in particular, have been implicated in mass mortality events and localized population declines are threatening some species with extinction. Transmission patterns for vector-borne diseases are influenced by the spatial distribution of vectors and are therefore not uniform across the landscape. Avian malaria is a globally distributed vector-borne disease that has been shown to affect endemic bird populations of North America. We evaluated shared habitat use between avian malaria vectors, mosquitoes in the genus Culex and a native grassland bird, the Greater Prairie-Chicken (Tympanuchus cupido), by (1) modeling the distribution of Culex spp. occurrence across the Smoky Hills of north-central Kansas using detection data and habitat variables, (2) assessing the occurrence of these vectors at nests of female Greater Prairie-Chickens, and (3) evaluating if shared habitat use between vectors and hosts is correlated with malarial infection status of the Greater Prairie-Chicken. Our results indicate that Culex occurrence increased at nest locations compared to other available but unoccupied grassland habitats; however the shared habitat use between vectors and hosts did not result in an increased prevalence of malarial parasites in Greater Prairie-Chickens that occupied habitats with high vector occurrence. We developed a predictive map to illustrate the associations between Culex occurrence and infection status with malarial parasites in an obligate grassland bird that may be used to guide management decisions to limit the spread of vector-borne diseases. ¬© 2016 The Society for Vector Ecology.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84969942279&doi=10.1111%2fjvec.12202&partnerID=40&md5=27002eaf25b661da18c5532d1c0a882e","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/scopus.ris",1

The development of new quantitative approaches that address the ecological complexity of P. knowlesi, particularly through a focus on its primary reservoir hosts, will be required to control it. Here, we review what is known about P. knowlesi transmission, identify key knowledge gaps in the context of current approaches to transmission modelling, and discuss the integration of these approaches with clinical parasitology and geostatistical analysis.

CCHF was detected in India recently. KFD virus has a wide range of tick vector species and involves several mammalian hosts. Until 2011, KFD was seen only in southern India, but recently its presence was confirmed in the Western Ghats region, including Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Goa¬ and Maharashtra states. This discovery has raised suspicion whether it existed earlier in these areas. Although, the risk of human-to-human transmission of this disease is very low, it is important to consider the high prevalence of the vectors namely ticks; small mammals, monkeys, and domestic animals that are carriers of infected ticks¬ as well as deforestation.

The consequences may result in the appearance and rise of mosquito-borne diseases, especially in remote tropical regions. Tropical regions can be the hotspots for the emergence of diseases due to high biological diversity and complex species interactions. Furthermore, frontier areas are often haphazardly surveyed as a result of inadequate or expensive sampling techniques, which limit early detection and medical intervention. We trialed a novel sampling technique of nonpowered traps and a carbon dioxide attractant derived from yeast and sugar to explore how land use influences mosquito communities on four remote, tropical islands in the Australian Torres Strait. Using this technique, we collected > 11,000 mosquitoes from urban and sylvan habitats. We found that human land use significantly affected mosquito communities. Mosquito abundances and diversity were higher in sylvan habitats compared with urban areas, resulting in significantly different community compositions between the two habitats. An important outcome of our study was determining that there were greater numbers of disease-vectoring species associated with human habitations. On the basis of these findings, we believe that our novel sampling technique is a realistic tool for assessing mosquito communities in remote regions. ¬© 2016 by The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84957686424&doi=10.4269%2fajtmh.15-0161&partnerID=40&md5=4573c5c062bc714f164c2af7069a3576","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/scopus.ris",1

Fifty arboviruses pathogenic for animals (including humans) have been reported, belonging to the families Asfarviridae, Bunyaviridae, Flaviviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Rhabdoviridae, Reoviridae, and Togaviridae. A wide variety of hematophagous arthropods transmits the arboviruses: biting midges, cimicid bugs, mosquitoes, sand flies, and ticks. The vector acquires the infection by blood feeding from a viremic host and transmits the virus to a new host by the oral route (inoculating infected saliva). However, vertical transmission routes already exist (transovarial, venereal). Arbovirus can be amplified by a diverse range of vertebrate hosts including birds, rodents, equines, humans, and monkeys. Through biological evolution and cultural development, human beings were able to modify the environments according to their needs. Thus, deforestation has produced new areas for agriculture, livestock, farming activities, and urbanization. These anthropogenic activities have produced great changes to host and vector communities and population abundance, sometimes driving emergence and reemergence of arboviruses. In this chapter, we give a general view for most important aspects of arboviruses, their classification, transmission and maintenance mechanisms, ecology, and emergence process. ¬© Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018894334&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-13884-8_5&partnerID=40&md5=a4d014a4c697c739870ce52d39b756f4","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/scopus.ris",1

In the advent of spreading behavioural resilience and physiological resistance to insecticidal nets and house spray, approaches to target more zoophilic, outdoor-biting vectors are being sought with increased urgency. Endectocides are insecticides applied to hosts which are taken up by the vectors during biting, and recent field assessments have demonstrated favourable results of cattle treated with ivermectin, diflubenzuron, eprinomectin and fipronil. Models were constructed to account for the modern, diverse vector feeding behaviours and assess their role in shaping malaria transmission and control with cattle-treated endectocides. Efficacy of this novel approach to malaria control is shown to be strongly dependent not only on intrinsic host preferences of the vector but also on how this preference is augmented by variation in the encounter rates with alternative blood-hosts. Ecological scenarios are presented whereby endectocides used on cattle yield equivalent, and in some cases improved, efficacy over nets and spray in controlling malaria transmission. Interactions between mosquito biting behaviours and relative availabilities of alternative blood-host species have largely been neglected in malaria programmatic strategy but will increasingly underlie sustaining the successes of vector control initiatives. ¬© 2015 The Author.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84971453947&doi=10.1016%2fj.parepi.2015.12.001&partnerID=40&md5=9df3b4df2d7065e87f8e5c51d5f9b7be","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/scopus.ris",1

Recent research into the ecology of infectious diseases indicates that the establishment of invasive plant species can trigger ecological cascades which alter the transmission dynamics of vector-borne pathogens that imperil human health. Here, we examined whether the presence or management of two invasive, emergent plants, cattails (Typha spp.) and phragmites (Phragmites australis), in stormwater dry detention basins (DDBs) alter the local distribution of vectors, avian hosts, or West Nile virus (WNV) transmission risk in an urban residential setting. Mosquitoes and birds were surveyed at 14 DDBs and paired adjacent residential sites. During the study period, emergent vegetation was mowed by site managers in three DDBs. In the absence of vegetation management, the overall abundance and species composition of both adult vectors and avian hosts differed between residential and DDB habitats; however, WNV entomological risk indices were equivalent. Communal bird roosts composed primarily of three species, European Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), Red-winged Blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus), and Common Grackles (Quiscalus quiscula), representing a broad range of WNV reservoir competence, were observed at half (three out of six) of the DDBs containing unmanaged stands of phragmites; however, their presence was associated with a lower seasonal increase in vector infection rate. Conversely, mowing of emergent vegetation resulted in a signifi cant and sustained increase in the abundance of WNV-infected vectors in DDBs and the increase in risk extended to adjacent residential sites. These fi ndings indicate that management of invasive plants in DDBs during the growing season can increase, while presence of communal bird roosts can decrease, WNV transmission risk. ¬© 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84959549185&doi=10.1890%2f15-0050%2fsuppinfo&partnerID=40&md5=f75bceb0447112a9b1f297c130dcf353","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/scopus.ris",1

By altering their behaviour in response to environmental stimuli, insects in highly variable landscapes can tailor their behaviour to their particular environment. In particular, female mosquitoes may benefit from plasticity in their choice of egg-laying site as these sites are often temporally variable and clustered. The opportunity to adapt egg-laying behaviour to past experience also exists for mosquito populations as females typically lay eggs multiple times throughout their lives. Whether experience and age affect egg-laying (or oviposition) behaviour in the mosquito Stegomyia aegypti (=Aedes aegypti) (Diptera: Culicidae) was assessed using a wind tunnel. Initially, gravid mosquitoes were provided with a cup containing either repellent or well water. After ovipositing in these cups, the mosquitoes were blood-fed and introduced into a wind tunnel. In this wind tunnel, an oviposition cup containing repellent was placed in the immediate vicinity of the gravid mosquitoes. A cup containing well water was placed at the opposite end of the tunnel so that if the females flew across the chamber, they encountered the well water cup, in which they readily laid eggs. Mosquitoes previously exposed to repellent cups became significantly more likely to later lay eggs in repellent cups, suggesting that previous experience with suboptimal oviposition sites informs mosquitoes of the characteristics of nearby oviposition sites. These results provide further evidence that mosquitoes modify behaviour in response to environmental information and are demonstrated in a vector species in which behavioural plasticity may be ecologically and epidemiologically meaningful. ¬© 2015 The Royal Entomological Society.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84937728213&doi=10.1111%2fmve.12119&partnerID=40&md5=cc844dd207fe367ef0ac1d3d6c0380e3","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/scopus.ris",1

The bromeliad-malaria paradigm assumes that transmission of Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium malariae involves species of the subgenus Kerteszia of Anopheles and only a few cases of P. vivax malaria are reported annually in this region. The expectations of this paradigm are a low prevalence of P. vivax and a null prevalence of P. falciparum. Therefore, the aim of this study was to verify if P. falciparum is actively circulating in the southeastern Brazilian Atlantic forest remains. Methods: In this study, anophelines were collected with Shannon and CDC-light traps in seven distinct Atlantic forest landscapes over a 4-month period. Field-collected Anopheles mosquitoes were tested by real-time PCR assay in pools of ten, and then each mosquito from every positive pool, separately for P. falciparum and P. vivax. Genomic DNA of P. falciparum or P. vivax from positive anophelines was then amplified by traditional PCR for sequencing of the 18S ribosomal DNA to confirm Plasmodium species. Binomial probabilities were calculated to identify non-random results of the P. falciparum-infected anopheline findings. Results: The overall proportion of anophelines naturally infected with P. falciparum was 4.4% (21/480) and only 0.8% (4/480) with P. vivax. All of the infected mosquitoes were found in intermixed natural and human-modified environments and most were Anopheles cruzii (22/25 = 88%, 18 P. falciparum plus 4 P. vivax). Plasmodium falciparum was confirmed by sequencing in 76% (16/21) of positive mosquitoes, whereas P. vivax was confirmed in only 25% (1/4). Binomial probabilities suggest that P. falciparum actively circulates throughout the region and that there may be a threshold of the forested over human-modified environment ratio upon which the proportion of P. falciparum-infected anophelines increases significantly. Conclusions: These results show that P. falciparum actively circulates, in higher proportion than P. vivax, among Anopheles mosquitoes of fragments of the southeastern Brazilian Atlantic forest. This finding challenges the classical bromeliad-malaria paradigm, which considers P. vivax circulation as the driver for the dynamics of residual malaria transmission in this region. ¬© 2015 Laporta et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84928779380&doi=10.1186%2fs12936-015-0680-9&partnerID=40&md5=e6bb61802a6b7c19958fb0f61b83f886","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/scopus.ris",1

Wolbachia can invade and spread to infect all individuals within wild mosquito populations, but requires a high rate of maternal transmission, strong cytoplasmic incompatibility and low fitness costs in the host in order to do so. Additionally, extensive differences in climate, field-release protocols, urbanization level and human density amongst the sites where this bacterium has been deployed have limited comparison and analysis of Wolbachia‚Äôs invasive potential. Methodology/Principal Findings: We examined key phenotypic effects of the wMel Wolbachia strain in laboratory Aedes aegypti mosquitoes with a Brazilian genetic background to characterize its invasive potential. We show that the wMel strain causes strong cytoplasmic incompatibility, a high rate of maternal transmission and has no evident detrimental effect on host fecundity or fertility. Next, to understand the effects of different urban landscapes on the likelihood of mosquito survival, we performed mark-release-recapture experiments using Wolbachia-uninfected Brazilian mosquitoes in two areas of Rio de Janeiro where Wolbachia will be deployed in the future. We characterized the mosquito populations in relation to the socio-demographic conditions at these sites, and at three other future release areas. We then constructed mathematical models using both the laboratory and field data, and used these to describe the influence of urban environmental conditions on the likelihood that the Wolbachia infection frequency could reach 100% following mosquito release. We predict successful invasion at all five field sites, however the conditions by which this occurs vary greatly between sites, and are strongly influenced by the size of the local mosquito population. Conclusions/Significance: Through analysis of laboratory, field and mathematical data, we show that the wMel strain of Wolbachia possesses the characteristics required to spread effectively in different urban socio-demographic environments in Rio de Janeiro, including those where mosquito releases from the Eliminate Dengue Program will take place. ¬© 2015 Dutra et al.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84929497437&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pntd.0003689&partnerID=40&md5=424552bf08ae1f7e251f01a6558ea449","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/scopus.ris",1

Less than 1% of WNV infections progress to clinical disease associated with severe neurological manifestations, including aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, and acute flaccid paralysis. Since its first isolation in the West Nile district of Uganda in 1937, a geographic expansion and westward spread of the virus has occurred during the last 20 years. Until recently, its medical and veterinary health concern was relatively low; however, the number, frequency and severity of outbreaks with neurological consequences in humans and horses have lately increased in Europe and the Mediterranean basin. Even though great advances have been obtained lately regarding WNV infection, and although efficient equine vaccines are available, no specific treatments or vaccines for human use are on the market. Peak WNV transmission occurs during mosquitoes' active period, usually between midsummer and early autumn.

Understanding and managing transmission potential in urban landscapes requires integration of sociological and ecological processes that regulate vector population dynamics, feeding behaviour and vector-pathogen interactions in these unique ecosystems. Vectorial capacity is a key metric for generating predictive understanding about transmission potential in systems with obligate vector transmission. This review evaluates how urban conditions, specifically habitat suitability and local temperature regimes, and the heterogeneity of urban landscapes can influence the biologically relevant parameters that define vectorial capacity: vector density, survivorship, biting rate, extrinsic incubation period and vector competence. Incidence of vector-borne disease in urban host populations is rarely, if ever, evenly distributed across an urban area. The persistence and quality of vector habitat can vary significantly across socio-economic boundaries to influence vector species composition and abundance, often generating socio-economically distinct gradients of transmission potential across neighbourhoods. Urban regions often experience unique temperature regimes, broadly termed urban heat islands (UHI). Arthropod vectors are ectothermic organisms, and their growth, survival and behaviour are highly sensitive to environmental temperatures. Vector response to UHI conditions is dependent on regional temperature profiles relative to the vector's thermal performance range. In temperate climates, UHI can facilitate increased vector development rates while having countervailing influence on survival and feeding behaviour. Understanding how urban heat island (UHI) conditions alter thermal and moisture constraints across the vector life cycle to influence transmission processes is an important direction for both empirical and modelling research. There remain persistent gaps in understanding of vital rates and drivers in mosquito-vectored disease systems, and vast holes in understanding for other arthropod-vectored diseases. Empirical studies are needed to better understand the physiological constraints and socio-ecological processes that generate heterogeneity in critical transmission parameters, including vector survival and fitness. Likewise, laboratory experiments and transmission models must evaluate vector response to realistic field conditions, such as variability in sociological and environmental conditions. ¬© 2015 British Ecological Society.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84935738651&doi=10.1111%2f1365-2435.12487&partnerID=40&md5=245211adae31252772f20c53f2fa66b3","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/scopus.ris",1

Four male sterile lines and 18 diverse pollinators as tester were used to produce 72 F1's. These crosses and parents were evaluated for different ornamental characteristics. Methods/Statistical Analysis: These F1 hybrids along with 22 parental lines were evaluated during the summer (2009) and rainy season (2009) in Randomized Block Design. Highly significant variances for all the traits indicated the sufficient variability was observed in the parental material for all the characters under study. Findings: Among male sterile lines, ms8 (summer season) and ms9 (rainy season) proved good general combiners, while testers Spray Mix -1, Bonita Bolero and Safari Queen were the best general combiners for both the seasons. However, cross combinations viz. ms8 x Hero, ms10 x Hero, ms10 x Cupidon Yellow, ms8 x Double Dwarf Lemon was the best in terms of specific combining ability during the summer. Whereas, during winter the combinations viz. ms9 x French Bonita-3, ms10 x French Bonita-3, ms9 x Bonita Bolero, ms8 x Sunkist and ms9 x French Bonita-2 were best specific combiners. In both the seasons, the ration of œÉ2 GCA/œÉ2 SCA was less than unity for all the characters showing the preponderance of dominance variance. Applications: Marigold is especially used for festive occasions, marriages, religious ceremonies, social function and in landscape plans because its having a wide range of attractive colours, shape and size having good keeping quality. Now a days, marigold is used as a source of pigment for poultry feed. Caretonoids is used as poultry feed mix and food colourant. Lutin, is major component of Caretonoid is having therapeutic values. Marigold cultivation controls the nematode population in as well as mosquito repellant products are also being used.

These residual ""hot spots"" are likely reservoirs of the parasite population and so are fundamental to the seasonal spread and decline of malaria. It is, therefore, important to understand the ecological conditions that permit vector mosquitoes to survive and forage in these specific areas. Features such as local waterways and vegetation, as well as local ecology, particularly nocturnal temperature, humidity, and vegetative sustainability, are important for modeling local mosquito behavior. Vegetation around a homestead likely provides refuge for outdoor resting of these insects and may be a risk factor for malaria transmission. Analysis of this vegetation can be done using satellite information and mapping programs, such as Google Earth, but manual quantification is difficult and can be tedious and subjective. A more objective method is required. Methods. Vegetation cover in the environment is reasonably static, particularly in and around homesteads. In order to evaluate and enumerate such information, ImageJ, an image processing software, was used to analyse Google Earth satellite imagery. The number of plants, total amount of vegetation around a homestead and its percentage of the total area were calculated and related to homesteads where cases of malaria were recorded. Results: Preliminary results were obtained from a series of field trials carried out in South East Zambia in the Choma and Namwala districts from a base at the Macha District Hospital. Conclusions: This technique is objective, clear and simple to manipulate and has potential application to determine the role that vegetation proximal to houses may play in affecting mosquito behaviour, foraging and subsequent malaria incidence. ¬© 2014 Ricotta et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84899093874&doi=10.1186%2f1475-2875-13-94&partnerID=40&md5=e0acd168b30b1372114f3e5df1b8ad49","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/scopus.ris",1

As humans come into increasing contact with the reservoir host (long-tailed macaques) as a consequence of deforestation, assessing the potential for a shift from zoonotic to sustained P. knowlesi transmission between humans is critical.Methods:A multi-host, multi-site transmission model was developed, taking into account the three areas (forest, farm, and village) where transmission is thought to occur. Latin hypercube sampling of model parameters was used to identify parameter sets consistent with possible prevalence in macaques and humans inferred from observed data. We then explore the consequences of increasing human-macaque contact in the farm, the likely impact of rapid treatment, and the use of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) in preventing wider spread of this emerging infection.Results:Identified model parameters were consistent with transmission being sustained by the macaques with spill over infections into the human population and with high overall basic reproduction numbers (up to 2267). The extent to which macaques forage in the farms had a non-linear relationship with human infection prevalence, the highest prevalence occurring when macaques forage in the farms but return frequently to the forest where they experience higher contact with vectors and hence sustain transmission. Only one of 1,046 parameter sets was consistent with sustained human-to-human transmission in the absence of macaques, although with a low human reproduction number (R0H = 1.04). Simulations showed LLINs and rapid treatment provide personal protection to humans with maximal estimated reductions in human prevalence of 42% and 95%, respectively.Conclusion:This model simulates conditions where P. knowlesi transmission may occur and the potential impact of control measures. Predictions suggest that conventional control measures are sufficient at reducing the risk of infection in humans, but they must be actively implemented if P. knowlesi is to be controlled. ¬© 2014 Imai et al.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84905457934&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pntd.0002978&partnerID=40&md5=386f566fffbf33d6eac77b393f1d245e","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/scopus.ris",1

However, the nation‚Äôs ongoing efforts to come to terms with the relationships between Aboriginal Australians and its settler colonial descendants coupled with the USA‚Äôs post-World War II cultural influence over Australian culture have complicated both Australia‚Äôs cultural identity and global perceptions of the nation. Consequently, Australian film must grapple with the traumas of the colonial past while interrogating and resisting Hollywood influence. As an Australian filmmaker who has succeeded both in his native land and within Hollywood, Peter Weir perhaps most clearly illustrates what Neil Rattigan refers to as this ‚Äúfundamental schizophrenia‚Äù of postcolonial Australia through both his work and career trajectory (Images 11). Weir cemented his reputation with a host of Australian films that directly address the nation‚Äôs legacy of British colonialism and its anxieties over its vast landscape and treatment of its indigenous population: the pastoral horror film The Cars That Ate Paris (1974), the meditation on the mysticism of the Australian landscape Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975), the World War I polemic Gallipoli (1981), and the Australian in Indonesia comparative postcolonial romance The Year of Living Dangerously (1982) (Stratton 57).

Effect of landscape and socio-economic factors on mosquito vector density was investigated with remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) inputs and developed the methodology for predicting spatial distribution of occurrence JE in the district. The methodology was validated during subsequent 5 years (2008-2012) and accuracy of forecasts has been assessed. Wetlands have been found to be the most preferred habitat type for majority of the JE transmitting mosquitoes followed by paddy growing areas and ponds. Based on the spatial distribution of habitat types, villages in the district divided into three categories of vector abundance and hence the risk of JE. Among socio-economic determinants, pig rearing habitat of the villagers have been found to be most significant. Based on the pig rearing distribution pattern in the village, all the villages have been categorized into three categories of JE virus reservoir abundance viz. high, medium and low. Along with these two categorization approaches, villages were also categorized into three relative scale based on retrospective data on disease intensity. Final JE risk map was prepared with integration of vector abundance map with the map of host abundance and retrospective disease intensity in GIS domain.

MDR malaria is the heritable and hypermutable property of human malarial parasite populations that can decrease in vitro and in vivo susceptibility to proven antimalarial drugs as they exhibit dose-dependent drug resistance and delayed parasite clearance time in treated patients. MDR malaria risk situations reflect consequences of the national policy and strategy as this influences the ongoing national-level or subnational-level implementation of malaria control strategies in endemic GMS countries. Based on our experience along with current literature review, the design of ecotope-based entomological surveillance (EES) and molecular xenomonitoring of MDR falciparum and vivax malaria parasites in Anopheles vectors is proposed to monitor infection pockets in transmission control areas of forest and forest fringe-related malaria, so as to bridge malaria landscape ecology (ecotope and ecotone) and epidemiology. Malaria ecotope and ecotone are confined to a malaria transmission area geographically associated with the infestation of Anopheles vectors and particular environments to which human activities are related. This enables the EES to encompass mosquito collection and identification, salivary gland DNA extraction, Plasmodium- and species-specific identification, molecular marker-based PCR detection methods for putative drug resistance genes, and data management. The EES establishes strong evidence of Anopheles vectors carrying MDR P. vivax in infection pockets epidemiologically linked with other data obtained during which a course of follow-up treatment of the notified P. vivax patients receiving the first-line treatment was conducted. For regional and global perspectives, the EES would augment the epidemiological surveillance and monitoring of MDR falciparum and vivax malaria parasites in hotspots or suspected areas established in most endemic GMS countries implementing the National Malaria Control Programs, in addition to what is guided by the World Health Organization. ¬© 2014 Prapa Sorosjinda-Nunthawarasilp and Adisak Bhumiratana.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84911885090&doi=10.1155%2f2014%2f969531&partnerID=40&md5=05dd26a98ef0d98bd216c3b744e46673","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/scopus.ris",1

Long-distance or migratory flights are strongly related to species ecological preferences and physiology, are survived by few specimens, and do not relate to nuisance situations. Nuisance-related or non-oriented flights are also species-specific and cover much shorter distances-between 25. m and 6. km for the 23 species analyzed. Based on these results, we made regression-based estimations of the percentages of the population that cross certain distances. A 90% reduction in breeding site population density would require minimal distances of 56. m for Anopheles saperoi and 8.6. km for Anopheles sinensis, and much greater distances for Aedes vexans, Culex quinquefasciatus, and Culiseta morsitans. Little useful information was available regarding the environmental conditions under which non-oriented flights took place. Qualitatively, the review showed that flight capacity was influenced by landscape structure, meteorological conditions (temperature, humidity, and illumination), and species physiology (energy available for flight). Overall, our findings suggest that predictions regarding the construction of barrier zones around breeding sites can be made based on mosquito and host density and human nuisance perception, and that barrier zone usefulness strongly depends on the mosquito species involved. Additional quantitative research is needed to better document the non-oriented dispersal patterns of the mosquitoes that populate rewetted and newly constructed wetlands, and the effects of vegetation types in barrier zones on mosquito densities. ¬© 2013 Elsevier GmbH.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84892146125&doi=10.1016%2fj.limno.2013.11.002&partnerID=40&md5=a1148ca2227e40c5055a5376f6af17b6","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/scopus.ris",1

A PCR based method targeting three distinct mitochondrial targets and subsequent DNA sequencing was used in an effort to delineate vector-host relationships. At Aruza Abajo, large domesticated mammals dominated the assemblage of mosquito blood meals while wild bird and mammal species represented only a small portion of the blood meal pool. Most mosquito species fed on a variety of hosts; foraging index analysis indicates that eight of nine mosquito species utilize hosts at similar proportions while a stochastic model suggests dietary overlap among species was greater than would be expected by chance. The results from our null-model analysis of mosquito diet overlap are consistent with the hypothesis that in landscapes where large domestic animals dominate the local biomass, many mosquito species show little host specificity, and feed upon hosts in proportion to their biomass, which may have implications for the role of livestocking patterns in vector-borne disease ecology.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84892410802&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0081788&partnerID=40&md5=d10b2c76cb596fe399ce0cdf8621ad17","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/scopus.ris",1

However, despite significant mitigation of JE in some Asian countries primarily due to vaccination programs and infrastructural development, JE continues to be a major disease burden in the Asian region. Arthropod-borne zoonotic infections such as JE present some of the greatest challenges to animal and human health globally. Their emergence involves a complex interplay of vectors, hosts, environment, climate, and anthropogenic factors. Therefore, the integrated management of infectious agents that affect both humans and animals is perhaps the most highly coveted strategy that public health policy makers aspire to attain in the twenty-first century. This is in response to the seemingly growing challenges of controling the burden of emerging infectious diseases such as shrinking financial budgets and resources, increasing demand for public health deliverables, demographic shifts and mobility, global trade economies, and climate and landscape changes.

In this model-based study, we investigate the interaction between host distributions and the spread of pests and diseases using an array of models that encompass the dispersal and spread of a diverse range of economically important species: a major insect pest of coniferous forests in western North America, the mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae); the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae, one of the most-widespread and best-studied bacterial plant pathogens; the mosquito Culex erraticus, an important vector for many human and animal pathogens, including West Nile Virus; and the oomycete Phytophthora infestans, the causal agent of potato late blight. Our model results reveal an interesting general phenomenon: a unimodal ('humpbacked') relationship in the magnitude of infestation (an index of dispersal or population spread) with increasing grain size (i.e., the finest scale of patchiness) in the host distribution. Pest and disease management strategies targeting different aspects of host pattern (e.g., abundance, aggregation, isolation, quality) modified the shape of this relationship, but not the general unimodal form. This is a previously unreported effect that provides insight into the spatial scale at which management interventions are most likely to be successful, which, notably, do not always match the scale corresponding to maximum infestation.

A better understanding of the ecology and distribution of malaria vectors is essential to design more effective and sustainable strategies for malaria control and elimination. Here, we analyzed the spatio-temporal risk of the contact between humans and the sympatric An. funestus and both M and S molecular forms of An. gambiae s.s. in an area of Benin with high coverage of vector control measures with an unprecedented level of resolution. Methods. Presence-absence data for the three vectors from 1-year human-landing collections in 19 villages were assessed using binomial mixed-effects models according to vector control measures and environmental covariates derived from field and remote sensing data. After 8-fold cross-validations of the models, predictive maps of the risk of the contact between humans and the sympatric An. funestus and both molecular M and S forms of An. gambiae s.s. were computed. Results: Model validations showed that the An. funestus, An. gambiae M form, and S form models provided an excellent (Area Under Curve>0.9), a good (AUC>0.8), and an acceptable (AUC>0.7) level of prediction, respectively. The distribution area of the probability of contact between human and An. funestus largely overlaps that of An. gambiae M form but this latter showed important seasonal variation. An. gambiae S form also showed seasonal variation but with different ecological preferences. Landscape data were useful to discriminate between the species' distributions. Conclusions: These results showed that available remote sensing data could help in predicting the human-vector contact for several species of malaria vectors at a village level scale. The predictive maps showed seasonal and spatial variations in the risk of human-vector contact for all three vectors.

For mosquitoes, existing spatial models use only habitat elements (hydrologic and floristic) to predict the distribution of disease vectors within the landscape, ignoring the potential importance of the distribution of hosts.We tested the hypothesis that the distribution of hosts would better explain the spatial distribution of mosquitoes than habitat variables using Information Theory and Poisson Regression. We analyzed the abundance of ectotherm-biting mosquitoes and their hosts from 37 points over a 28-km2 area in Tuskegee National Forest, Alabama, USA. We compared models built using information regarding habitat, hosts, or both for their ability to explain the abundance of Culex peccator and Culex territans, two mosquito species that specialize on reptiles and amphibians. Models built using both host and habitat information were the best models for both species, suggesting that information regarding the distribution of mosquito hosts greatly improves models of mosquito distributions. Moreover, when differences in habitat makeup among stations were accounted for, mosquitoes were found to be significantly more abundant at locations with greater host abundance. Since most mosquitoes feed on only a limited range of hosts and successful blood feeding is one of the most crucial bottlenecks in the life cycle of mosquitoes, it follows that mosquitoes would aggregate in areas of greatest host density. Habitat influences the availability of suitable larval development sites, and to some extent, distribution of hosts. Our analysis, however, shows that within the landscape the distribution of host animals is a crucial factor in determining the spatial distribution of vectors. This has clear and important implications for determining which areas are at a greater risk for zoonotic arboviruses and is a potentially transformative paradigm for understanding the factors that influence the spatial distribution of disease vectors. ¬© 2013 Burkett-Cadena et al.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84894596932&doi=10.1890%2fES13-00009.1&partnerID=40&md5=9bd194957ea6f4cb900ea3a5dc6d4d37","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/scopus.ris",1

We focus on the zoonotic alphaviruses Venezuelan equine encephalitis and chikungunya viruses, which have undergone adaptive evolution that mediated recent outbreaks of disease, as well as the flaviviruses dengue and West Nile viruses, which have emerged via less dramatic adaptive mechanisms. ¬© 2013 Future Medicine Ltd.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84873363206&doi=10.2217%2ffmb.12.139&partnerID=40&md5=0ea1d871b29b93fb06e38e967224ea38","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/scopus.ris",1

Since the JEV distribution area has been large and continuously extending toward new Asian and Australasian regions, it is considered an emerging and reemerging pathogen. Despite large effective immunization campaigns, Japanese encephalitis remains a disease of global health concern. JEV zoonotic transmission cycles may be either wild or domestic: the first involves wading birds as wild amplifying hosts; the second involves pigs as the main domestic amplifying hosts. Culex mosquito species, especially Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, are the main competent vectors. Although five JEV genotypes circulate, neither clear-cut genotype-phenotype relationship nor clear variations in genotype fitness to hosts or vectors have been identified. Instead, the molecular epidemiology appears highly dependent on vectors, hosts' biology, and on a set of environmental factors. At global scale, climate, land cover, and land use, otherwise strongly dependent on human activities, affect the abundance of JEV vectors, and of wild and domestic hosts. Chiefly, the increase of rice-cultivated surface, intensively used by wading birds, and of pig production in Asia has provided a high availability of resources to mosquito vectors, enhancing the JEV maintenance, amplification, and transmission. At fine scale, the characteristics (density, size, spatial arrangement) of three landscape elements (paddy fields, pig farms, human habitations) facilitate or impede movement of vectors, then determine how the JEV interacts with hosts and vectors and ultimately the infection risk to humans. If the JEV is introduced in a favorable landscape, either by live infected animals or by vectors, then the virus can emerge and become a major threat for human health. Multidisciplinary research is essential to shed light on the biological mechanisms involved in the emergence, spread, reemergence, and genotypic changes of JEV. ¬© 2013 Le Flohic et al.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84884683981&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pntd.0002208&partnerID=40&md5=c64d92e72ee319de7c59564959649615","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/scopus.ris",1

Biodiversity loss affects infectious disease risk by disrupting normal relationships between hosts and pathogens. Mosquito-borne pathogens respond to changing dynamics on multiple transmission levels and appear to increase in disturbed systems, yet current knowledge of mosquito diversity and the relative abundance of vectors as a function of habitat change is limited. We characterize mosquito communities across habitats with differing levels of anthropogenic ecological disturbance in central Thailand. During the 2008 rainy season, adult mosquito collections from 24 sites, representing 6 habitat types ranging from forest to urban, yielded 62,126 intact female mosquitoes (83,325 total mosquitoes) that were assigned to 109 taxa. Female mosquito abundance was highest in rice fields and lowest in forests. Diversity indices and rarefied species richness estimates indicate the mosquito fauna was more diverse in rural and less diverse in rice field habitats, while extrapolated estimates of true richness (Chao1 and ACE) indicated higher diversity in the forest and fragmented forest habitats and lower diversity in the urban. Culex sp. (Vishnui subgroup) was the most common taxon found overall and the most frequent in fragmented forest, rice field, rural, and suburban habitats. The distributions of species of medical importance differed significantly across habitat types and were always lowest in the intact, forest habitat. The relative abundance of key vector species, Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus, was negatively correlated with diversity, suggesting that direct species interactions and/or habitat-mediated factors differentially affecting invasive disease vectors may be important mechanisms linking biodiversity loss to human health.

To search for such effects in tropical Australia, we sampled mosquito populations across anthropogenic disturbance gradients of grassland, artificial rainforest edge, and rainforest interior. From >15,000 captured mosquitoes, we identified 26 species and eight genera. Surprisingly, there was no significant difference in community composition or species richness between forest edges and grasslands, but both differed significantly from rainforest interiors. Mosquito species richness was elevated in grasslands relative to the rainforest habitats. Seven species were unique to grasslands and edges, with another 13 found across all habitats. Among the three most abundant species, Culex annulirostris occurred in all habitat types, whereas Verrallina lineata and Cx. pullus were more abundant in forest interiors.

Environmentally, four main concerns are mapped out: first, there are potential water safety risks, such as water resource abuse, water pollution and groundwater recharge deficiency; second, unreasonable construction will lead to land-use overexpansion, land pollution and service expectancy reduction; third, microalgae production may exert a detrimental effect on the local ecosystem, causing algal blooms and biological invasion; finally, microalgae might emit unexpected greenhouse gases [nitrogen oxides (NOx), methane (CH 4)] and ammonia (NH3). From an economic risk standpoint, microalgae production requires an overwhelming investment due to the expensive start-up and operation. Socially, contaminant discharge will threaten the health of local animals and people. Moreover, the safety effects of genetically modified algae may not be immediately apparent or known. In addition, over time, microalgae may become a medium for mosquitoes to spread disease. From a cultural point of view, it requires time for people in developing countries to adapt algal oil to their daily life as an alternative to conventional fossil fuels. Furthermore, personnel changes in the workforce may harm existing cultural structures, and landscape aesthetics may be affected by system construction. Taking the above challenges into consideration, efficient government policies, proactive company behaviours and positive public participation will play an important role in minimising or even eliminating these potential risks. ¬© 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84861424367&doi=10.1080%2f13504509.2011.636083&partnerID=40&md5=cf7ba3deb6ece1ffafc02a5fb8d9d417","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/scopus.ris",1

A more complete understanding of the phenotypic correlates of these diverse swarms is needed in order to equate RNA swarm breadth and composition to specific adaptive and evolutionary outcomes. Results: Here, we determined clonal fitness landscapes of mosquito cell-adapted West Nile virus (WNV) and assessed how altering the capacity for interactions among variants affects mutant swarm dynamics and swarm fitness. Our results demonstrate that although there is significant mutational robustness in the WNV swarm, genetic diversity also corresponds to substantial phenotypic diversity in terms of relative fitness in vitro. In addition, our data demonstrate that increasing levels of co-infection can lead to widespread strain complementation, which acts to maintain high levels of phenotypic and genetic diversity and potentially slow selection for individual variants. Lastly, we show that cooperative interactions may lead to swarm fitness levels which exceed the relative fitness levels of any individual genotype. Conclusions: These studies demonstrate the profound effects variant interactions can have on arbovirus evolution and adaptation, and provide a baseline by which to study the impact of this phenomenon in natural systems. ¬© 2012 Ciota et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84861380346&doi=10.1186%2f1471-2148-12-58&partnerID=40&md5=fd3bb99ab0e10aaa68a4b345850b7662","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/scopus.ris",1

More broadly, these experiments demonstrate that model systems provide an economical framework for testing different mosquito and mosquito-borne pathogen control strategies and can ultimately inform field interventions and enable better allocation of intervention resources. ¬© 2011 Entomological Society of America.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-82055164198&doi=10.1603%2fME11085&partnerID=40&md5=d0626807c27772c780fc3821442dd5a8","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/scopus.ris",1

Consequently, arboviruses are distributed worldwide and represent over 30% of all emerging infectious diseases identified in the past decade. Although some arboviral infections go undetected or are associated with mild, flu-like symptoms, many are important human and veterinary pathogens causing serious illnesses such as arthritis, gastroenteritis, encephalitis and hemorrhagic fever and devastating economic loss as a consequence of lost productivity and high mortality rates among livestock. One of the most consistent molecular features of emerging arboviruses, in addition to their near exclusive use of RNA genomes, is the inclusion of viral, non-structural proteins that act as interferon antagonists. In this review, we describe these interferon antagonists and common strategies that arboviruses use to counter the host innate immune response. In addition, we discuss the complex interplay between host factors and viral determinants that are associated with virus emergence and re-emergence, and identify potential targets for vaccine and anti-viral therapies. ¬© 2011 by the authors; licensee MDPI.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79959634863&doi=10.3390%2fv3060629&partnerID=40&md5=9851a1a58a18f3f847bc41baa1e880aa","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/scopus.ris",1

However, lineage-specific restrictions on the adaptive processes remain largely unexplored. Recently, a Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) lineage of African origin emerged to cause major epidemics of severe, persistent, debilitating arthralgia in Africa and Asia. Surprisingly, this new lineage is actively replacing endemic strains in Southeast Asia that have been circulating there for 60 y. This replacement process is associated with adaptation of the invasive CHIKV strains to an atypical vector, the Aedes albopictus mosquito that is ubiquitously distributed in the region. Herewedemonstrate that lineage-specific epistatic interactions between substitutions at amino acid positions 226 and 98 of the E1 envelope glycoprotein, the latter of which likely resulted from a founder effect, have for 60 y restricted the ability of endemic Asian CHIKV strains to adapt to this new vector. This adaptive constraint appears to be allowing invasion of the unoccupied vector niche by Ae. albopictus-adapted African strains. These results underscore how different adaptive landscapes occupied by closely related viral genotypes can profoundly affect the outcome of viral evolution and disease emergence.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79956355315&doi=10.1073%2fpnas.1018344108&partnerID=40&md5=f5b9c3bf81f2efb3f77e7e59e6a0931e","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/scopus.ris",1

Originally a zoonosis transmitted by sylvan mosquitoes to Old World primates, dengue has emerged as a cosmotropical urban pathogen now maintained in most endemic areas by human-vector contacts, especially with the domestic and anthropophilic mosquito Aedes aegypti. Epidemics with mortality from dengue hemorrhagic fever have become increasingly common in the Neotropics since the 1981 lethal outbreak in Cuba. In this contribution the status of the disease in Latin America is revised, and the characteristics of vector biology contributing to its emergence and predominance in urban areas are explored. Although the causes for the re-emergence of dengue are many, the following factors are identified as important: 1) unplanned urbanization increasing breeding habitats of the vector, in close association with high concentrations of potential human hosts; 2) cultural aspects that result in urban landscapes dominated by large numbers of abandoned water-holding containers next to high concentrations of potential human hosts; 3) socioeconomic factors, including poor sanitation, lack of reliable water, high densities of dwellings and residents in small spaces, and others; and 4) increases in human movements that promote the transport of viral serotypes and genotypes to new regions and that increase the number of susceptible humans in infected areas. Dengue control programs based solely on the application of pesticides will never be effective or sustainable. Communitybased source reduction programs aimed at reducing or eliminating water-holding containers occupied by the vector are currently being promoted as the most effective solution for reducing the incidence of dengue fever.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79951748522&partnerID=40&md5=db5fae32b156dca2f84d720f7ee815da","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,"Resurgencia del dengue en Am√©rica: Pautas, procesos y prospectos",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/scopus.ris",1

This work analyses the spatial distribution of potential vector mosquitoes in relation to landscape characteristics in an urban environment in a temperate climate region. Mosquitoes were trapped monthly from October 2005 to March 2006 in 25 sites within Crdoba city and suburbs with miniature light traps+CO2. Nine species were collected, and the most abundant were Culex quinquefasciatus (37.1%), C. apicinus (26.6%) and Aedes aegypti (13.9%). Species that may be involved in SLEv transmission were recorded throughout the sampling. C. quinquefasciatus was detected in 92% of the sites; however, only two sites showed consistently larger collections. The site of highest C. quinquefasciatus abundance was located within an area of high Saint Louis Encefalitis virus prevalence and risk of infection, further supporting this species involvement as a vector. Significant correlations were detected between land cover characteristics and abundance of C. apicinus, C. interfor and C. maxi that were consistent with previous knowledge about their larval habitat and domestic preferences, which may be useful for targeting vector control operations. ¬© 2009 Cambridge University Press.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77951099333&doi=10.1017%2fS0007485309006919&partnerID=40&md5=2c087e01ac801facd1e5190d8f992083","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/scopus.ris",1

We analysed data from pupal surveys and mark-release-recapture experiments (non-blood-fed females were released) carried out in two dengue endemic neighbourhoods of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil: Tubiacanga (a suburb, with a human density of 337 inhabitants/ha) and Favela do Amorim (a slum, with a human density of 901 inhabitants/ha). In both areas, host-seeking females of three different release cohorts showed an overall non-uniform and extensive dispersal from their release point within 1-2 days post-release. At 4-5 days post-release, when many of the released females would be expected to be gravid, in Tubiacanga most mosquitoes were collected in areas with a relatively higher density of containers/premise, independently of the density of residents/house, whereas in Favela do Amorim, almost half of the captured mosquitoes were collected in relatively resource-poorer areas. Although Ae. aegypti dispersal patterns varied between sites, overall the distances travelled from the release point and the cumulative flight directions were correlated with the density of containers and hosts, more markedly in Tubiacanga than in Favela do Amorim. ¬© 2010 The Authors.

A total of 31 species was recorded. Contrary to expectations, the host-seeking mosquito fauna was less diverse in the forest canopy than in the understorey. In particular, species diversity and evenness were higher in understorey samples, whereas species richness estimates were similar in both habitats.

And of the various maladies that plagued both armies, few were more pervasive than malaria-a mosquito-borne illness that afflicted over 1.1 million soldiers serving in the Union army alone. Yellow fever, another disease transmitted by mosquitos, struck fear into the hearts of military planners who knew that ""yellow jack"" could wipe out an entire army in a matter of weeks. In this ground-breaking medical history, Andrew McIlwaine Bell explores the impact of these two terrifying mosquito-borne maladies on the major political and military events of the 1860s, revealing how deadly microorganisms carried by a tiny insect helped shape the course of the Civil War. Soldiers on both sides frequently complained about the annoying pests that fed on their blood, buzzed in their ears, invaded their tents, and generally contributed to the misery of army life. Little did they suspect that the South's large mosquito population operated as a sort of mercenary force, a third army, one that could work for or against either side depending on the circumstances. Malaria and yellow fever not only sickened thousands of Union and Confederate soldiers but also affected the timing and success of certain key military operations. Some commanders took seriously the threat posed by the southern disease environment and planned accordingly; others reacted only after large numbers of their men had already fallen ill. African American soldiers were ordered into areas deemed unhealthy for whites, and Confederate quartermasters watched helplessly as yellow fever plagued important port cities, disrupting critical supply chains and creating public panics. Bell also chronicles the effects of disease on the civilian population, describing how shortages of malarial medicine helped erode traditional gender roles by turning genteel southern women into smugglers. Southern urbanites learned the value of sanitation during the Union occupation only to endure the horror of new yellow fever outbreaks once it ended, and federal soldiers reintroduced malaria into non-immune northern areas after the war. Throughout his lively narrative, Bell reinterprets familiar Civil War battles and events from an epidemiological standpoint, providing a fascinating medical perspective on the war. By focusing on two specific diseases rather than a broad array of Civil War medical topics, Bell offers a clear understanding of how environmental factors serve as agents of change in history. Indeed, with Mosquito Soldiers, he proves that the course of the Civil War would have been far different had mosquito-borne illness not been part of the South's landscape in the 1860s. ¬© 2010 by Louisiana State University Press.

In particular, this ecologicalclassification concerns different families and viral genera, but all the viruses included inthe same classification, are characterized by transmission through arthropod bites. Theseviruses can be responsible for human infections ranging from asymptomatic or mild onesto fatal illness, like encephalitis and hemorrhagic fevers. The most important arbovirusescausing human pathology are included in three viral families, Togaviridae (genusAlphavirus), Flaviviridae, and Bunyaviridae.Different distribution of encephalitic arboviruses exists among various areas of theworld, however generally these viruses are present, in large or small degree, in all thetemperate or warm climate regions, and sometimes also in more cold areas (but in thiscase only in the hot season). The diffusion of these infections parallels the cycle of theirvectors: especially mosquitoes, ticks and phlebotomes. Habitat modification induced bymen, as deforestation, can change the ecology of vectors and the epidemiology ofencephalitides transmitted by arboviruses, but also of other vector-borne diseases. Thisphenomenon is due both to climate and to demographic changes, and in particular occursin South America, West and Central Africa and in South-East Asia. Moreover also the rapidity of modern transports has contributed to encephalitic arboviruses new localizationareas that sometimes are more adapted to cause major epidemic phenomena. Themodification in reservoir host environment and the viral agents adaptation to new hosts,represent the main cause of pattern modification of these infections in the world. WestNile virus is a classic example of this phenomenon. In fact, recently, this virus wasintroduced in the Western Hemisphere. Consequently arboviruses can no more beconsidered specific of particular regions of the world, but represent a more wide potentialdanger for men. Since the acquired immunity of population against some arboviruses andthe lability in the external environment of a large part of them may risk their extinction,the evolution has adopted a dual host tropism strategy for viral survival: reservoir hostsand final, or occasional hosts. Men just sometimes represent the last ones that may haveclinical manifestations.In order to prevent these serious pathologies, because there are no specific therapiesfor arboviral encephalitides, fight against vectors and vaccines employ can constitute theonly defences for these diseases. For example effective vaccines exist against Tick-borneencephalitis virus (TBEV) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV).In conclusion in our chapter we analyse the general questions concerning thearboviral encephalitides in the world (biological characteristics of the causative agents,epidemiology, pathogenicity, diagnosis and prophylaxis) and in the last part of this paperwe analyse the Italian situation. In fact, beginning from 2000 we have studied theepidemiology of arboviruses in Piedmont and in particular in the Turin Province.

The contact rate between people and potential malaria vectors, or the human biting rate, is one of the key factor to predict the risk of re-emergence of malaria, would the parasite be introduced in the region. Our model (called MALCAM) represents the different agents that could influence malaria transmission in the Camargue - people, mosquitoes, animal hosts and the landscape - in a spatially explicit environment. The model simulates spatial and temporal variations in human biting rate at the landscape scale. These variations depend on the distribution of people and potential vectors, their behaviour and their interactions. A land use/cover map was used as a cellular-spatial support for the movements of and interactions between mobile agents. The model was tested for its sensitivity to variations in parameter values, and for the agreement between field observations and model predictions. The MALCAM model provides a tool to better understand the interactions between the multiple agents of the disease transmission system, and the land use and land cover factors that control the spatial heterogeneity in these interactions. It allows testing hypotheses and scenarios related to disease dynamics by varying the value of exogenous biological, geographical, or human factors. This application of agent-based modelling to a human vector-borne disease can be adapted to different diseases and regions. ¬© 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Land use/land cover and land surface temperature images were derived from Terra's Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer imagery. An analytical procedure using landscape metrics was developed, applying configuration analysis of landscape patterns in the study area. The positive reports of mosquitoes and animal hosts for WNV in fall, 2001-2006, were collected from the Cook County Public Health Department. Forty-nine municipalities were found to have WNV-positive records in mosquitoes and animal hosts in fall 2004. Socioeconomic data were obtained from the 2000 US Census. Statistical analysis was applied to WNV data in fall 2004 to identify the relationship between potential predictors and WNV spread. As a result, landscape factors, such as landscape aggregation index and the urban areas and areas of grass and water, showed strong correlations with the WNV-positive records. Socioeconomic conditions, such as the population over 65 years old, also showed a strong correlation with WNV-positive records. Thermal conditions of water showed a less but still considerable correlation to WNV-positive records. This research offers an opportunity to explore the effects of landscape pattern, land surface temperature, and socioeconomic conditions on the spread of WNV caused by mosquitoes and animal hosts. Results can contribute to public health and environmental management in the study area. ¬© 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-70450263703&doi=10.1007%2fs10661-008-0618-6&partnerID=40&md5=2395d3cdb247f515c36c3ea22d811239","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/scopus.ris",1

Depending on the type alteration and the life histories of parasites and hosts, parasitism may increase or decrease. To investigate whether parasitism in tropical amphibians was associated with land use change, I studied three species of amphibians, Rana vaillanti, Eleutherodactylus fitzingeri, and Smilisca puma from the Province of Heredia, Costa Rica, in the Atlantic lowlands. Frogs were collected and examined for parasites during the rainy seasons of 2001-2003 from sites in forest or clear-cut cattle pastures. The abundances of five species of parasites and parasite species richness of R. vaillanti were significantly higher in pasture habitat. A single parasite species shared by E. fitzingeri and S. puma showed a trend of increased abundance in pasture habitats. Overall, the abundances of six parasite species (three trematodes, an intestinal nematode, an encysted nematode, and a filarial nematode) were higher in pastures, while two species (trematodes) were higher in forest. This study suggests that land use activities in tropical regions affects the abundance and richness of amphibian parasites. Converting forest to pasture may impact the abundance of amphibian parasites because subsequent water quality changes (e.g. eutrophication, higher pH) often enhance habitat and resources for intermediate hosts (e.g. snails, mosquitoes) involved in parasite life cycles. Aquatic amphibians (e.g. R. vaillanti) may be particularly prone to experiencing increases in parasitism in agricultural habitats due to the positive relationship between many aquatic intermediate hosts and water quality changes associated with agricultural land use. ¬© 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Two species [great egret (Ardea alba) and snowy egret (Egretta thula)] nest in mixed-species colonies on islands in Narragansett Bay and regularly forage in adjacent salt marshes. We surveyed 13 salt marshes approximately twice weekly during the breeding and post-breeding seasons in 2001 and 2002. Based on resource selection functions, foraging great and snowy egrets strongly preferred pools within salt marshes, while mosquito control ditches were rarely used. Foraging egrets were never detected in stands of common reed (Phragmites australis). The number of egrets using individual marshes varied considerably, although density estimates were far less variable. Salt marsh area was better at predicting the mean number of foraging egrets using a marsh than landscape-level parameters, such as distance to the nearest nesting colony or the total area of salt marsh within 5 km. Carefully designed salt marsh restoration projects could benefit local egret populations because it appears that foraging habitat availability may be a limiting factor. To ensure use by foraging egrets, salt marsh restoration designs should increase the availability of pool and open water habitat, reduce common reed, and modify deep ditches and channels to make them more accessible for foraging egrets. ¬© 2006, The Society of Wetland Scientists.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33845804216&doi=10.1672%2f0277-5212%282006%2926%5b307%3aAHSBFE%5d2.0.CO%3b2&partnerID=40&md5=68d3f48fb7ec4222d187b097dab49a06","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/scopus.ris",1

Similar surveillance programs in all three areas monitored infection rates in mosquitoes, seroconversion rates in sentinel chickens, seroprevalence in wild birds, numbers of dead birds reported by the public, and the occurrence of human cases. Infection rates in Culex tarsalis Coquillett and sentinel chicken seroconversion rates were statistically similar among all three areas, indicating that highly competent mosquito hosts were capable of maintaining enzootic WNV transmission among less competent and widely distributed avian hosts, most likely house sparrows and house finches. In contrast, infection rates in Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus Say were statistically higher in Kern and Los Angeles counties with elevated corvid populations than in Coachella Valley with few corvids. Spatial analyses of dead corvids showed significant clusters near known American crow roosts in Los Angeles that were congruent with clusters of human cases. In this area, the incidence of human and Cx. p. quinquefasciatus infection was significantly greater within corvid clusters than without, indicating their importance in virus amplification and as a risk factor for human infection.

The host-feeding patterns of Ae. albopictus were investigated during the 2002 and 2003 mosquito seasons in suburban neighborhoods in Wake County, Raleigh, NC. Hosts of blood-fed Ae. albopictus (n = 1,094) were identified with an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, by using antisera made in New Zealand White rabbits to the sera of animals that would commonly occur in peridomestic habitats. Ae. albopictus fed predominantly on mammalian hosts (83%). Common mammalian hosts included humans (24%), cats (21%), and dogs (14%). However, a notable proportion (7%) of bloodmeals also was taken from avian hosts. Some bloodmeals taken from birds were identified to species by a polymerase chain reaction-heteroduplex assay (PCR-HDA). Ae. albopictus fed predominantly on chickens and a northern cardinal. PCR-HDA failed to produce detectable products for 29 (58%) of 50 bloodmeals for which DNA had been amplified, indicating that these mosquitoes took mixed bloodmeals from avian and nonavian hosts. Ae. albopictus preference for humans, dogs, and cats was determined by calculating host-feeding indices for the three host pairs based on the proportion of host specific blood-fed mosquitoes collected in relation to the number of specific hosts per residence as established by a door-to-door survey conducted in 2003. Estimates of the average amount of time that residents and their pets (cats and dogs) spent out of doors were obtained. Host-feeding indices based only on host abundance indicated that Ae. albopictus was more likely to feed on domestic animals. However, when feeding indices were time-weighted, Ae. albopictus fed preferentially upon humans. Ae. albopictus blood feeding on humans was investigated using a STR/PCR-DNA profiling technique that involved amplification of three short tandem repeats loci. Of 40 human bloodmeals, 32 (80%) were from a single human, whereas eight (20%) were multiple bloodmeals taken from more than one human host. We conclude that the blood-feeding preference of Ae. albopictus for mammals will limit acquisition of arboviruses by this species from infected avian amplification hosts. This feeding preference likely limits the vector potential of Ae. albopictus for North American arboviruses. ¬© 2006 Entomological Society of America.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33745242533&doi=10.1603%2f0022-2585%282006%2943%5b543%3aHPOAAD%5d2.0.CO%3b2&partnerID=40&md5=4c28521b0f6c7750fdc19b2c8ba2dff3","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/scopus.ris",1

The timing of virus appearance and quail infection coincided well with the appearance of chicks in nature, leading us to hypothesize that large coveys containing these non-immune birds could be important in focal virus amplification in rural settings. However, experimental infection studies with chicks, juveniles, and adults of both quail species using sympatric strains of WEEV, SLEV, and WNV indicated that only immature birds were competent hosts for WEEV, producing viremias sufficiently elevated to efficiently infect Culex tarsalis mosquitoes. Quail were less competent hosts for WNV and were incompetent for SLEV. Large populations of quail that frequently are infected with SLEV or WNV, but produce low to moderate viremias, may serve as dead end hosts for these viruses. Due to their abundance and repeated infection, these birds may attenuate virus amplification in rural areas of California and possibly could be one reason why WNV epidemics seem to occur more frequently in urban and periurban than in rural landscapes. ¬© Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33751236467&doi=10.1089%2fvbz.2006.6.248&partnerID=40&md5=61eb95b89432afc645d6df033caf22fb","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/scopus.ris",1

The current study uses geographic information systems (GIS) and logistic regression analyses to model the distribution of WNV in the state of Georgia based on a wild bird indicator system, and to identify human and environmental predictor variables that are important in the determination of WNV distribution. A database for Georgia was constructed that included (1) location points of all the avian samples tested for WNV, (2) local land use classifications, including temperature, physiographic divisions, land use/landcover, and elevation, (3) human demographic data from the U.S. Census, and (4) statistics summarizing land cover, elevation, and climate within a 1-km-radius landscape around each sample point. Logistic regression analysis was carried out using the serostatus of avian collection sites as the dependent variable. Temperature, housing density, urban/suburban land use, and mountain physiographic region were important variables in predicting the distribution of WNV in the state of Georgia. While weak, the positive correlation between WNV-antibody positive sites and the urban/suburban environment was consistent throughout the study period.

Previously, only subtype IAB and IC VEE virus strains had been associated with major outbreaks of equine and human disease. The IAB and IC epizootics are believed to emerge via adaptation of enzootic (sylvatic, equine-avirulent) strains for high titer equine viremia that results in efficient infection of mosquito vectors. However, experimental equine infections with subtype IE equine isolates from the Mexican outbreaks demonstrated neurovirulence but little viremia, inconsistent with typical VEE emergence mechanisms. Therefore, we hypothesized that changes in the mosquito vector host range might have contributed to the Mexican emergence. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the susceptibility of the most abundant mosquito in the deforested Pacific coastal locations of the VEE outbreaks and a proven epizootic vector, Ochlerotatus taeniorhynchus. The Mexican epizootic equine isolates exhibited significantly greater infectivity compared with closely related enzootic strains, supporting the hypothesis that adaptation to an efficient epizootic vector contributed to disease emergence. Reverse genetic studies implicated a Ser ‚Üí Asn substitution in the E2 envelope glycoprotein as the major determinant of the increased vector infectivity phenotype. Our findings underscore the capacity of RNA viruses to alter their vector host range through minor genetic changes, resulting in the potential for disease emergence.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-3843069697&doi=10.1073%2fpnas.0402905101&partnerID=40&md5=999df031aa195eb8bdd08630433b6e8f","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/scopus.ris",1

Transmission of malaria depends on the interaction between the vector (mosquito Anopheles), the parasite (plasmedium), the hosts and the environment. The time span for the parasite to evolve into anopheles and it is survival rate combined with human exposure determine malaria infection risk. The malaria and mosquito life cycles are directly related to many factors such as precipitation, humidity and temperature. Besides, there are others factors contributing to the increasing of disease all over the world: parasite ant malarial drug resistance; mosquito insecticide resistance; environmental changes (deforestation, construction of dams); climatic changes; migration; population increase and lack of organized health system. For controlling malaria spread it will be necessary an efficient vaccine associate with effective monitoring systems. While the scientists do not obtain this vaccine, it is necessary to improve monitoring techniques.

As everywhere, vector-borne diseases are the result of complex and variable epidemiological systems, subject both to biogeographical rules and human activity. Two main arboviroses are present in Indonesia: dengue and Japanese encephalitis. Dengue appears as an endemoepidemic disease and is mostly circumscribed to urban areas. Haemorrhagic cases were first observed in 1968; since then, the incidence has been constantly increasing and the disease is now one of the principal causes of child lethality. Japanese encephalitis is a rural endemic disease transmitted by rice-field mosquitoes; its incidence remains relatively low since pigs, which are usual link-hosts for the virus, are uncommon in this mainly Muslem country. Human clinical cases are recorded from non-Muslem islands such as Bali or Irian Jaya which raises the question of immunisation for travellers. Recently, Japanese encephalitis was observed on east of the Wallace line which had been considered as the eastern cut-off line. Malaria is common throughout the country, Plasmodium vivax being the most frequent species. Some of the Anopheline vectors are related to brackish water as are coastal species; others have been favoured by rice growing. Several species bite and rest outdoors, rendering control measures complex. Moreover, chloroquine resistance is increasing in both P. falciparum and P. vivax. All three filaria species responsible for human lymphatic filariasis exist in Indonesia. Bancroft filariasis is present in rather limited foci on most of the islands; malayan filariasis is very prevalent on many islands, mostly in coastal areas, and Timor filariasis exist only on a few small islands. These parasitic diseases are cumulative and do not pratically endanger the health of travellers. In the past, plague was common on Java island, but today, human cases are very rare. Scrub typhus is prevalent everywhere, as is murine typhus, being very frequent in harbour cities and one of the main causes of hospitalisation for febrile syndromes.. On the whole, the situation of several of these diseases has been worsening in Indonesia for about thirty years. Although epidemiological situations constantly evolve, two recent occurrences should be paid particular attention: - transmigration which is now a national priority and greatly facilitates the spread of many pathogens, arboviroses or chloroquine-resistant plasmodia, but also of rats, mosquitoes, etc. - deforestation due either to land-farming by Javanese transmigrants or to sudden climatic changes such as El Ni√±o in 1997. Such deep ecological transformations may have considerable and unforeseeable consequences on the epidemiology of vector-borne diseases in Indonesia.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-24644469294&partnerID=40&md5=91198195d287bf644edce9d03b1c49be","Export Date: 20 December 2020",NA,"La situation des maladies √† vecteurs en Indon√©sie",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Analisis/naive_19Dec20/scopus.ris",1

The abundance, activity, shell selection and behaviour of three species of hermit crab are related to the level of mangrove cover. With increased density of mangrove trees, the study species of hermit crab changed in abundance, tended to become diurnal, spent more time feeding and were clustered in larger groups when doing so, and selected longer spired shells. All five of the same variables are also linked to the proximity and activity of humans through both direct and indirect actions. Direct effects included a tendency to nocturnal activity with proximity to human activity; indirect effects included increased and more clumped food supplies, and shell middens from intertidal harvesting and deforestation. Mangroves are important to local human populations as well as to hermit crabs, for a wide variety of (similar) reasons. Mangroves provide storm shelter, fisheries and fishery nursery grounds for adjacent human settlements, but they also harbour mosquito populations and their removal provides valuable building materials and fuel. Hermit crabs may be useful (indirectly) to coastal human populations by being a source of food to certain commercial species, and by quickly consuming rotting/discarded food and faeces (thereby reducing disease and pests). They can also cause minor problems to coastal human populations because they use shells of (fisheries) target mollusc species and can be more abundant than the living molluscs, thereby slowing down effective hand collection through confusion over identification.

Evolution in this field has helped in the introduction of various initiatives related to public health informatics. Surveillance systems in the area of health informatics utilizing social media information have been developed for early prediction of disease outbreaks and to monitor diseases. In the past few years, the availability of social media data, particularly Twitter data, enabled real-time syndromic surveillance that provides immediate analysis and instant feedback to those who are charged with follow-ups and investigation of potential outbreaks. In this paper, we review the recent work, trends, and machine learning(ML) text classification approaches used by surveillance systems seeking social media data in the healthcare domain. We also highlight the limitations and challenges followed by possible future directions that can be taken further in this domain. Methods: To study the landscape of research in health informatics performing surveillance of the various health-related data posted on social media or web-based platforms, we present a bibliometric analysis of the 1240 publications indexed in multiple scientific databases (IEEE, ACM Digital Library, ScienceDirect, PubMed) from the year 2010-2018. The papers were further reviewed based on the various machine learning algorithms used for analyzing health-related text posted on social media platforms. Findings:: Based on the corpus of 148 selected articles, the study finds the types of social media or web-based platforms used for surveillance in the healthcare domain, along with the health topic(s) studied by them. In the corpus of selected articles, we found 26 articles were using machine learning technique. These articles were studied to find commonly used ML techniques. The majority of studies (24%) focused on the surveillance of flu or influenza-like illness (ILI). Twitter (64%) is the most popular data source to perform surveillance research using social media text data, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) (33%) being the most used ML algorithm for text classification. Conclusions: The inclusion of online data in surveillance systems has improved the disease prediction ability over traditional syndromic surveillance systems. However, social media based surveillance systems have many limitations and challenges, including noise, demographic bias, privacy issues, etc. Our paper mentions future directions, which can be useful for researchers working in the area. Researchers can use this paper as a library for social media based surveillance systems in the healthcare domain and can expand such systems by incorporating the future works discussed in our paper.","","J BIOMED INFORM","1532-0480",NA,"Background: Real-time surveillance in the field of health informatics has emerged as a growing domain of interest among worldwide researchers.

The prevalence among infected vectors and hosts is a hot topic in veterinary science throughout the entire continent, as well as the development of efficient diagnostic procedures, therapy and prophylactic measures. Companion animal vector-borne diseases comprise a large group of pathogens including viruses, bacteria, protozoa and helminths. These pathogens are mainly transmitted by bloodsucking arthropods (ticks, fleas, mosquitos, sand flies), and more seldom by direct transmission between vertebrate hosts. Vector prevalence and activity is influenced by local climate conditions, host species density, changes in landscape and land use. Human parameters such as poverty and migration affect the use of prophylactic measures against pathogen transmission and infection as well as increasing the zoonotic risk to introducing pathogens by infected humans. Small animal associated factors such as pet trade and pet travel spread infection and certain vectors such as ticks and fleas.

Small animal associated factors such as pet trade and pet travel spread infection and certain vectors such as ticks and fleas. All these factors pose several complex and significant challenges for veterinarians in clinical practice to decide on efficient laboratory work-up and constructive diagnostic procedures.","DOAJ Gold",NA,"WOS:000540849900001",7,NA,"canine babesiosis; diagnostic procedures; dirofilariosis; leishmaniosis; tick-borne encephalitis",NA,NA,NA,147,"WARSAW","0567-8315",NA,"BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A, WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND","0567-8315",NA,NA,"",NA,"Veterinary Sciences","LY9LP",0,7,NA,"2020-12-20",7,"SCIENDO",0,104,"J","Leschnik, M","Analisis/naive_19Dec20/wos.txt",1

However, the distribution of WNV transmission is dependent on the mosquito vector and the ecological requirements, which vary from one place to another. Methods: Presence/density data of two WNV mosquito vectors, Culex nigripalpus and Cx. quinquefasciatus, was extracted within 5 km buffer zones around seropositive records of sentinel chickens in order to delineate their predicting variables and model the habitat suitability of probable infective mosquito using MaxEnt software. Different correlations between density data of the extracted mosquito vectors and 27 climate, land use-land cover, and land surface terrain variables were analyzed using linear regression analysis. Accordingly, the correlated predicting variables were used in building up habitat suitability model for the occurrence records of both mosquito vectors using MaxEnt. Results: The density of both WNV mosquito vectors showed variation in their ecological requirements. Eight predicting variables, out of 27, had significant influence on density of Cx. nigripalpus. Precipitation of driest months was shown to be the best predicting variable for the density of this vector (R-2 = 41.70). Whereas, two variables were proven to predict the distribution of Cx. quinquefasciatus density. Vegetation showed the maximum predicting gain to the density of this mosquito vector (R-2 = 15.74), where nestling birds, in particular exotics, are found. Moreover, Jackknife analysis in MaxEnt demonstrated that urbanization and vegetation data layers significantly contribute in predicting habitat suitability of Cx. nigripalpus and Cx. quinquefasciatus occurrence, respectively, which justifies the contribution of the former in urban and the latter in epizootic transmission cycles of WNV. In addition, habitat suitability risk maps were produced for both vectors in response to their predicting variables. Conclusions: For the first time in the study area, a quantitative relationship between 27 predicting variables and two WNV mosquito vectors within their foraging habitats was highlighted at the local scale. Accordingly, the predicting variables were used to produce a practical distribution map of probable infective mosquito vectors. This substantially helps in determining where suitable habitats are found. This will potentially help in designing target surveillance and control programmes, saving money, time and man-power. However, the suitability risk maps should be updated when serological and entomological data updates are available.","","PARASITE VECTOR","",NA,"Background: The lack of available vaccines and consistent sporadic transmission of WNV justify the need for mosquito vector control and prediction of their geographic distribution.

Whether deforestation directly or indirectly affects the prevalence of avian haemosporidian parasites through their hosts and/or vectors is still not well understood. We sampled understory bird communities (insectivorous, frugivorous, granivorous and nectarivorous birds) and mosquitoes in three habitats showing a gradient of deforestation (pristine forest, fragmented forest, and young palm oil plantation), to assess the effects of habitat changes on avian haemosporidian (Plasmodium and Haemoproteus) prevalence and its relationship to bird feeding guilds and mosquito abundance.

Plasmodium infections were detected in 136 individuals (16.09%) and varied significantly among habitat types while Haemoproteus infections were detected in 98 individuals (11.60%) and did not vary significantly among habitat types. However, the prevalence of Plasmodium and Haemoproteus in bird feeding groups varied significantly among habitats. Nectarivorous and granivorous birds had the highest Plasmodium and Haemoproteus prevalence, respectively.

We compared vector abundance and species composition at two forest edge sites abutting pastureland and two forest interior sites in New Zealand, while simultaneously assessing avian malaria prevalence in silvereyes (Zosterops lateralis). Twenty-two of 240 (9.2%) individual silvereyes captured across all sites tested positive for avian malaria, and Plasmodium prevalence was nearly identical in edge and interior habitats. A total of 580 mosquito specimens were trapped across all sites. These comprised five different species: the introduced Aedes notoscriptus and Culex quinquefasciatus; the native A. antipodeus, C. asteliae and C. pervigilans. The known avian malaria vector C. quinquefasciatus was only recorded in the forest edge (mostly at ground level). In contrast, the probable vector C. pervigilans was abundant and widespread in both edge and interior sites.

We compared vector abundance and species composition at two forest edge sites abutting pastureland and two forest interior sites in New Zealand, while simultaneously assessing avian malaria prevalence in silvereyes (Zosterops lateralis). Twenty-two of 240 (9.2%) individual silvereyes captured across all sites tested positive for avian malaria, and Plasmodium prevalence was nearly identical in edge and interior habitats. A total of 580 mosquito specimens were trapped across all sites. These comprised five different species: the introduced Aedes notoscriptus and Culex quinquefasciatus; the native A. antipodeus, C. asteliae and C. pervigilans. The known avian malaria vector C. quinquefasciatus was only recorded in the forest edge (mostly at ground level). In contrast, the probable vector C. pervigilans was abundant and widespread in both edge and interior sites.

Here, we used high-hydrostatic-pressure nuclear magnetic resonance (HHP-NMR) to obtain residue-specific information on the folding process of domain III from serotype 4 dengue virus (DEN4-ED3), which adopts the classical three-dimensional (3D) ss-sandwich structure known as the Ig-like fold. Interestingly, the folding pathway of DEN4-ED3 shares similarities with that of the Titin I27 module, which also adopts an Ig-like fold, but is functionally unrelated to ED3. For both proteins, the unfolding process starts by the disruption of the N- and C-terminal strands on one edge of the ss-sandwich, yielding a folding intermediate stable over a substantial pressure range (from 600 to 1000 bar). In contrast to this similarity, pressure-jump kinetics indicated that the folding transition state is considerably more hydrated in DEN4-ED3 than in Titin I27.","","BIOMOLECULES","2218-273X",NA,"Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne endemic disease in tropical and subtropical regions, causing a significant public health problem in Southeast Asia.

In contrast to this similarity, pressure-jump kinetics indicated that the folding transition state is considerably more hydrated in DEN4-ED3 than in Titin I27.","DOAJ Gold, Green Published",31357538,"WOS:000484457600014",3,NA,"high-hydrostatic-pressure nuclear magnetic resonance; thermodynamic stability; protein folding",NA,NA,NA,NA,"BASEL","",NA,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","",NA,NA,"This research was funded partly by the Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) research grant (KAKENHI-18H02385), and the Institute of Global Innovative Research (GIR, TUAT).",NA,"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology","IV7OY",2,0,NA,"2020-12-20",3,"MDPI",2,42,"J","Saotome, T; Doret, M; Kulkarni, M; Yang, YS; Barthe, P; Kuroda, Y; Roumestand, C","Analisis/naive_19Dec20/wos.txt",1

Methods Over a 3-year period, we sampled mosquitoes, sandflies and biting-midges in forested habitats of central Panama.

Results We collected 168 405 adult haematophagous dipterans in total, including 26 genera and 86 species. Pristine forest settings were always more taxonomically diverse than the disturbed forest sites, confirming that disturbance has a negative impact on species richness. Species of Phlebotominae and Culicoides were mainly classified as climax (i.e. forest specialist) or disturbance-generalist, which tend to decrease in abundance along with rising levels of disturbance. In contrast, a significant portion of mosquito species, including primary and secondary disease vectors, was classified as colonists (i.e. disturbed-areas specialists), which tend to increase in numbers towards more disturbed forest habitats. At pristine forest, the most prevalent species of Phlebotominae and Culicoides partitioned the vertical niche by being active at the forest canopy or in the understorey; yet this pattern was less clear in disturbed habitats. Most mosquito species were not vertically stratified in their habitat preference. Conclusion We posit that entomological risk and related pathogen exposure to humans is higher in pristine forest scenarios for Culicoides and Phlebotominae transmitted diseases, whereas forest disturbance poses a higher entomological risk for mosquito-borne infections. This suggests that the Dilution Effect Hypothesis (DEH) does not apply in tropical rainforests where highly abundant, yet unrecognised insect vectors and neglected zoonotic diseases occur. Comprehensive, community level entomological surveillance is, therefore, the key for predicting potential disease spill over in scenarios of pristine forest intermixed with anthropogenic habitats. We suggest that changes in forest quality should also be considered when assessing arthropod-borne disease transmission risk.","","NAT COMMUN","",NA,"Objective To explore possible changes in the community attributes of haematophagous insects as a function of forest disturbance.

Particularly important in urban regions, where these species have evolved to breed in man-made containers and feed nearly exclusively on human hosts, the threat of vector-borne disease has risen in recent decades due to the growth of cities, progression of climate change, and increase in globalization. While the dynamics of Aedes populations in urban settings have been well studied in relation to ecological features of the landscape, relatively less is known about the relationship between neighborhood socioeconomic status and Aedes infestation. Here, we compare infestation levels of both A. aegypti and A. albopictus in four socioeconomically contrasting neighborhoods of urban Panama City, Panama. Our results indicate that infestation levels for both Aedes species vary between neighborhoods of contrasting socioeconomic status, being higher in neighborhoods having lower percentage of residents with bachelor degrees and lower monthly household income. Additionally, we find that proximity between socioeconomically contrasting neighborhoods can predict infestation levels by species, with A. aegypti increasing and A. albopictus decreasing with proximity between neighborhoods. These findings hold key implications for the control and prevention of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika in Panama, a region with ongoing arbovirus outbreaks and high economic inequity.

Integrating social and ecological data to model metapopulation dynamics in coupled human and natural systems	ECOLOGY			English	Article						agent-based model; black rail; coupled human and natural system; data integration for population models Special Feature; irrigation; land-use change; metapopulation; rangeland; social-ecological system; stochastic patch occupancy model; Virginia rail; wetland; working landscape	CALIFORNIA BLACK RAILS; WEST NILE VIRUS; LAND-USE; CLIMATE; CONSERVATION; BIODIVERSITY; EXTINCTION; POLICY; ENVIRONMENT; LANDSCAPES	Understanding how metapopulations persist in dynamic working landscapes requires assessing the behaviors of key actors that change patches as well as intrinsic factors driving turnover. Coupled human and natural systems (CHANS) research uses a multidisciplinary approach to identify the key actors, processes, and feedbacks that drive metapopulation and landscape dynamics. We describe a framework for modeling metapopulations in CHANS that integrates ecological and social data by coupling stochastic patch occupancy models of metapopulation dynamics with agent-based models of land-use change. We then apply this framework to metapopulations of the threatened black rail (Laterallus jamaicensis) and widespread Virginia rail (Rallus limicola) that inhabit patchy, irrigation-fed wetlands in the rangelands of the California Sierra Nevada foothills. We collected data from five diverse sources (rail occupancy surveys, land-use change mapping, a survey of landowner decision making, climate and reservoir databases, and mosquito trapping and West Nile virus testing) and integrated them into an agent-based stochastic patch occupancy model. We used the model to (1) quantify the drivers of metapopulation dynamics, and the potential interactions and feedbacks among them; (2) test predictions of the behavior of metapopulations in dynamic working landscapes; and (3) evaluate the impact of three policy options on metapopulation persistence (irrigation district water cutbacks during drought, incentives for landowners to create wetlands, and incentives for landowners to protect wetlands). Complex metapopulation dynamics emerged when landscapes functioned as CHANS, highlighting the importance of integrating human activities and other ecological processes into metapopulation models. Rail metapopulations were strongly top-down regulated by precipitation, and the black rail's decade-long decline was caused by the combination of West Nile virus and drought. Theoretical predictions of the two metapopulations' responses to dynamic landscapes and incentive programs were complicated by heterogeneity in patch quality and CHANS couplings, respectively.

Discovery of new antimalarial drugs with novel chemotypes or modes of action lie at the heart of these efforts. There is a particular interest in drug candidates that target stages of the malaria parasite lifecycle beyond the symptomatic asexual blood stages. This is especially important given the spectre of emerging drug resistance to all current frontline antimalarials. One approach gaining increased interest is the potential of designing novel drugs that target parasite passage from infected individual to feeding mosquito and back again. Action of such therapeutics is geared much more at the population level rather than just concerned with the infected individual. The search for novel drugs active against these stages has been helped by improvements to in vitro culture of transmission and pre-erythrocytic parasite lifecycle stages, robotic automation and high content imaging, methodologies that permit the high-throughput screening (HTS) of compound libraries for drug discovery. Here, we review recent advances in the antimalarial screening landscape, focussed on transmission blocking as a key aim for drug-treatment campaigns of the future.

Despite this well-accepted narrative, the underlying mechanisms driving this association remain unclear. We introduce a nuanced hypothesis, the 'coevolution effect'. The central concept is that the subdivision of host populations which occurs with habitat fragmentation causes localized coevolution of hosts, obligate parasites, and pathogens which act as 'coevolutionary engines' within each fragment, accelerating pathogen diversification, and increasing pathogen diversity across the landscape. When combined with a mechanism to exit a fragment (e.g., mosquitoes), pathogen variants will spill over into human communities. Through this combined ecoevolutionary approach we may be able to understand the fine-scale mechanisms that drive disease emergence in the Anthropocene.

In endemic areas, behavioral aspects of anopheline vectors such as host preference, biting time and resting location post blood meal have a key impact on malaria transmission dynamics and vector control interventions. Nyssorhynchus darlingi presents a range of feeding and resting behaviors throughout its broad distribution.MethodsTo investigate the genetic diversity related to biting behavior, we collected host-seeking Ny. darlingi in two settlement types in Acre, Brazil: Granada (20-year-old, more established, better access by road, few malaria cases) and Remansinho (8-year-old, active logging, poor road access, high numbers malaria cases). Mosquitoes were classified by the location of collection (indoors or outdoors) and time (dusk or dawn).ResultsGenome-wide SNPs, used to assess the degree of genetic divergence and population structure, identified non-random distributions of individuals in the PCA for both location and time analyses. Although genetic diversity related to behavior was confirmed by non-model-based analyses and F-ST values, model-based STRUCTURE detected considerable admixture of these populations.ConclusionsTo our knowledge, this is the first study to detect genetic markers associated with biting behavior in Ny. darlingi. Additional ecological and genomic studies may help to understand the genetic basis of mosquito behavior and address appropriate surveillance and vector control.

Malaria vector species in Amazonian Peru co-occur in larval habitats but have distinct larval microbial communities	PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES			English	Article							ANOPHELES-DARLINGI DIPTERA; PLASMODIUM-VIVAX; NYSSORHYNCHUS RANGELI; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; BREEDING SITES; GUT MICROBIOTA; CULICIDAE; MOSQUITOS; BACTERIA; SEQUENCES	In Amazonian Peru, the primary malaria vector, Nyssorhynchus darlingi (formerly Anopheles darlingi), is difficult to target using standard vector control methods because it mainly feeds and rests outdoors. Larval source management could be a useful supplementary intervention, but to determine its feasibility, more detailed studies on the larval ecology of Ny. darlingi are essential. We conducted a multi-level study of the larval ecology of Anophelinae mosquitoes in the peri-Iquitos region of Amazonian Peru, examining the environmental characteristics of the larval habitats of four species, comparing the larval microbiota among species and habitats, and placing Ny. darlingi larval habitats in the context of spatial heterogeneity in human malaria transmission. We collected Ny. darlingi, Nyssorhynchus rangeli (formerly Anopheles rangeli), Nyssorhynchus triannulatus s.l. (formerly Anopheles triannulatus s.l.), and Nyssorhynchus sp. nr. konderi (formerly Anopheles sp. nr. konderi) from natural and artificial water bodies throughout the rainy and dry seasons. We found that, consistent with previous studies in this region and in Brazil, the presence of Ny. darlingi was significantly associated with water bodies in landscapes with more recent deforestation and lower light intensity. Nyssorhynchus darlingi presence was also significantly associated with a lower vegetation index, other Anophelinae species, and emergent vegetation. Though they were collected in the same water bodies, the microbial communities of Ny. darlingi larvae were distinct from those of Ny. rangeli and Ny. triannulatus s.l., providing evidence either for a species-specific larval microbiome or for segregation of these species in distinct microhabitats within each water body. We demonstrated that houses with more reported malaria cases were located closer to Ny. darlingi larval habitats; thus, targeted control of these sites could help ameliorate malaria risk. The co-occurrence of Ny. darlingi larvae in water bodies with other putative malaria vectors increases the potential impact of larval source management in this region. Author summary The standard methods used to combat mosquitoes that transmit malaria, long-lasting insecticide treated nets and indoor residual spraying, target mosquitoes that bite people indoors and rest indoors after biting. In Amazonian Peru, the major malaria vector, Nyssorhynchus darlingi (formerly Anopheles darlingi), is known to bite and rest mostly outdoors and to feed on animals as well as humans. Therefore, additional methods are needed to control this species, such as targeting immature mosquitoes in water bodies using chemical or biological larvicides or environmental modification. To determine whether this is feasible, more ecological information about Ny. darlingi larval habitats in this region is needed. In this study, we found that Ny. darlingi were more likely to be collected from water bodies in more deforested areas, and in the presence of other species of mosquitoes that transmit malaria. We characterized the bacteria detected in three species of mosquito larvae, and found that the species of mosquito, and not the water body, determined which bacteria were identified. As we found that houses with more malaria cases were located closer to Ny. darlingi larval habitats, management of larval habitats may be an effective method to reduce the risk of malaria in this region.

Simplification of vector communities during suburban succession	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ALBOPICTUS DIPTERA-CULICIDAE; AEDES-ALBOPICTUS; LAND-USE; MOSQUITO DISTRIBUTION; DISEASE RISK; DIVERSITY; TRAPS; FIELD; TRISERIATUS; JAPONICUS	Suburbanization is happening rapidly on a global scale, resulting in changes to the species assemblages present in previously undeveloped areas of land. Community-level changes after anthropogenic land-use change have been studied in a variety of organisms, but the effects on arthropods of medical and veterinary importance remain poorly characterized. Shifts in diversity, abundance, and community composition of such arthropods, like mosquitoes, can significantly impact vector-borne disease dynamics due to varying vectorial capacity between different species. In light of these potential implications for vector-borne diseases, we investigated changes in mosquito species assemblage after suburbanization by sampling mosquitoes in neighborhoods of different ages in Wake County, North Carolina, US. We found that independent of housing density and socioeconomic status, mosquito diversity measures decreased as suburban neighborhoods aged. In the oldest neighborhoods, the mosquito assemblage reached a distinct suburban climax community dominated by the invasive, peridomestic container-breeding Aedes albopictus, the Asian tiger mosquito. Aedes albopictus is a competent vector of many pathogens of human concern, and its dominance in suburban areas places it in close proximity with humans, allowing for heightened potential of host-vector interactions. While further research is necessary to explicitly characterize the effects of mosquito community simplification on vector-borne disease transmission in highly suburbanized areas, the current study demonstrates that suburbanization is disrupting mosquito communities so severely that they do not recover their diversity even 100 years after the initial disturbance. Our understanding of the community-level effects of anthropogenic land-use change on arthropod vectors will become increasingly important as we look to mitigate disease spread in a global landscape that is continually developed and altered by humans.

This species is usually abundant in the forests where it occurs, preferring to live and feed on canopies, behaviour known as acrodendrophily. However, in several studies and locations this species has been observed in high density near the ground in the forest. In this study, it was hypothesized that factors associated with anthropogenic landscape changes may be responsible for the variation in abundance and acrodendrophily observed in An. cruzii.MethodsThe study was conducted in a conservation unit in the city of SAo Paulo, Brazil. Monthly entomological collections were performed from March 2015 to April 2017, and the resulting data were used with data from another study conducted in the same area between May 2009 and June 2010. Mosquitoes were collected from five sites using CDC and Shannon traps. Landscape composition and configuration metrics were measured, and generalized linear mixed-effect models were used to investigate the relationship between these metrics and variations in the abundance and acrodendrophily of An. cruzii.ResultsThe model that showed the best fit for the relationship between landscape metrics and An. cruzii abundance suggests that an increase in the proportion of forest cover leads to an increase in the abundance of this mosquito, while the model that best explained variations in An. cruzii acrodendrophily suggests that an increase in total forest-edge length leads to greater activity by this species at ground level.ConclusionWhile the data indicate that changes in landscape due to human activities lead to a reduction in An. cruzii abundance, such changes may increase the contact rate between this species and humans living on the edges of forest fragments where An. cruzii is found. Future studies should, therefore, seek to elucidate the effect of these landscape changes on the dynamics of Plasmodium transmission in the Atlantic Forest, which according to some studies includes the participation of simian hosts.

In some urban areas, this expansion has resulted in this invasive species being elevated as an important vector of dengue virus. Ornamental plants are often a feature of the urban landscape that may provide harborage for mosquitoes. Because adult mosquitoes require carbohydrates for subsistence, landscape vegetation may provide natural sugar sources to meet those needs. The aim of our study was to determine whether feeding on different ornamental plants from urban areas affects the survivorship and fecundity of Ae. albopictus. Newly emerged mosquitoes were given access to 11 ornamental plant species (6 flowering, 5 nonflowering) as sugar sources under laboratory conditions. Generally, survivorship was greater significantly when mosquitoes fed upon the ornamentals compared with those that were offered only water, whereas survivorship was shortened when individuals fed only on sucrose (P < 0.05). Mosquitoes that fed on nonflowering plants laid fewer eggs compared with those exposed to flowering plants. No significant difference was observed in egg hatch from females feeding on any of the plant species. Our findings provide insight into the potential influence that urban ornamental plants may have on the ecology of adult Ae. albopictus. The results of this study provide new avenues for integrated mosquito management in urban landscaped areas by planting ornamental plant species that contribute to lower survivorship and fecundity of peridomestically produced mosquitoes.

Novel insights into endogenous RNA viral elements in Ixodes scapularis and other arbovirus vector genomes	VIRUS EVOLUTION			English	Article						endogenous viral element; arthropod; paleovirology; viral diversity; Ixodes scapularis	ST-LOUIS ENCEPHALITIS; AEDES-AEGYPTI; SEQUENCE; VIRUSES; TRANSMISSION; EVOLUTION; DEFENSE; ALPHAVIRUS; BLUETONGUE; DIVERSITY	Many emerging arboviruses are not transmitted by traditional mosquito vectors, but by lesser-studied arthropods such as ticks, midges, and sand flies. Small RNA (sRNA) silencing pathways are the main antiviral defence mechanism for arthropods, which lack adaptive immunity. Non-retroviral integrated RNA virus sequences (NIRVS) are one potential source of sRNAs which comprise these pathways. NIRVS are remnants of past germline RNA viral infections, where viral cDNA integrates into the host genome and is vertically transmitted. In Aedes mosquitoes, NIRVS are widespread and produce PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). These are hypothesised to target incoming viral transcripts to modulate viral titre, perhaps rendering the organism a more efficient arbovirus vector. To explore the NIRVS landscape in alternative arbovirus vectors, we validated the NIRVS landscape in Aedes spp. and then identified novel NIRVS in six medically relevant arthropods and also in Drosophila melanogaster. We identified novel NIRVS in Phlebotomus papatasi, Culicoides sonorensis, Rhipicephalus microplus, Anopheles gambiae, Culex quinquefasciatus, and Ixodes scapularis. Due to their unexpected abundance, we further characterised NIRVS in the black-legged tick I. scapularis (n = 143). Interestingly, NIRVS are not enriched in R. microplus, another hard tick, suggesting this is an Ixodes-specific adaptation. I. scapularis NIRVS are enriched in bunya- and orthomyxo-like sequences, reflecting that ticks are a dominant host for these virus groups. Unlike inmosquitoes, I. scapularis NIRVS are more commonly derived from the nonstructural region (replicase) of negative-sense viruses, as opposed to structural regions (e.g. glycoprotein). Like other arthropods, I. scapularis NIRVS preferentially integrate into genomic piRNA clusters, and serve as a template for primary piRNA production in the commonly used embryonic I. scapularis ISE6 cell line. Interestingly, we identified a two-fold enrichment of non-long terminal repeat (non-LTR) retrotransposons, in genomic proximity to NIRVS, contrasting with studeis in Ae. aegypti, where LTR retrotransposons are instead associated with NIRVS formation. We characterised NIRVS phylogeny and integration patterns in the important vector, I. scapularis, revealing they are distinct from those in Aedes spp. Future studies will explore the possible antiviral mechanism conferred by NIRVS to I. scapularis, which may help the transmission of pathogenic arboviruses. Finally, this study explored NIRVS as an untapped wealth of viral diversity in arthropods.

In Amazonian Peru, the identification of the most productive, positive water bodies would increase the impact of targeted mosquito control on aquatic life stages. The present study explores the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) for identifying Nyssorhynchus darlingi (formerly Anopheles darlingi) breeding sites with high-resolution imagery ( 0.02m/pixel) and their multispectral profile in Amazonian Peru. Our results show that high-resolution multispectral imagery can discriminate a profile of water bodies where Ny. darlingi is most likely to breed (overall accuracy 86.73%- 96.98%) with a moderate differentiation of spectral bands. This work provides proof-of-concept of the use of high-resolution images to detect malaria vector breeding sites in Amazonian Peru and such innovative methodology could be crucial for LSM malaria integrated interventions. Author summary The most efficient malaria vector in the Latin American region is Nyssorhynchus darlingi (formerly Anopheles darlingi). In Amazonian Peru, where malaria is endemic, Ny. darlingi feeds both indoors and outdoors (endophagy, exophagy), depending on the local environment, and rests outdoors (exophily). LLINs and IRS, the most common tools employed for vector control, target endophagic and endophilic mosquitoes. Thus, they are only partially effective against Ny. darlingi. Control of the aquatic stages of vector mosquitoes, larval source management (LSM), targets the most productive breeding sites nearest to human habitation. In four riverine communities, we used drones with high-resolution imagery as a key initial step to analyze water bodies within the estimated flight range of Ny. darlingi, 1 km. We found distinctive spectral profiles for water bodies that were positive versus negative for Ny. darlingi. The methodology and analysis reported here provide the basis for testing whether LSM can be combined successfully with LLINs and IRS to contribute to the elimination of transmission in malaria hotspots in the Amazon.

Marm			Land Use and Larval Habitat Increase Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae) and Culex quinquefasciatus (Diptera: Culicidae) Abundance in Lowland Hawaii	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Culex; Aedes; larval survey; land use; avian malaria	WEST-NILE-VIRUS; AVIAN MALARIA; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; FEEDING-BEHAVIOR; PIPIENS DIPTERA; VECTOR; MOSQUITOS; CHIKUNGUNYA; POPULATION; DYNAMICS	Vector abundance plays a key role in transmission of mosquito-borne disease. In Hawaii, Aedes albopictus (Skuse) (Diptera: Culicidae), the Asian tiger mosquito, has been implicated in locally-transmitted dengue outbreaks, while Culex quinquefasciatus Say (Diptera: Culicidae), the southern house mosquito, is the primary vector of avian malaria, a wildlife disease that has contributed to declines and extinctions of native Hawaiian birds. Despite the importance of these introduced species to human and wildlife health, little is known about the local-scale drivers that shape mosquito abundance across lowland Hawaii, where forest, agricultural, and residential land uses are prevalent. We examined landscape, larval habitat, and climate drivers of Ae. albopictus and Cx. quinquefasciatus abundance in eight lowland wet forest fragments on the Big Island of Hawaii. We found that the abundance of both species increased with the proportion of surrounding developed land and the availability of larval habitat, which were themselves correlated. Our findings suggest that conversion of natural habitats to residential and agricultural land increases mosquito larval habitats, increasing the abundance of Ae. albopictus and Cx. quinquefasciatus and increasing disease risk to humans and wildlife in Hawaii. Our results further indicate that while source reduction of artificial larval habitats-particularly moderately-sized human-made habitats including abandoned cars and tires-could reduce mosquito abundance, eliminating larval habitat will be challenging because both species utilize both natural and human-made larval habitats in lowland Hawaii.

Shady business: understanding the spatial ecology of exophilic Anopheles mosquitoes	MALARIA JOURNAL			English	Article						Exophilic; Anopheles; Landscape; Canopy; Land cover	WEST-NILE-VIRUS; MALARIA TRANSMISSION; IDENTIFICATION; CHALLENGES; ARABIENSIS; CULICIDAE; BEHAVIOR; DIPTERA; EASTERN; WATER	Background: Understanding the ecology of exophilic anophelines is a key step toward developing outdoor control strategies to complement existing indoor control tools against malaria vectors. This study was conducted to assess the movement pattern of exophilic Anopheles mosquitoes between blood meal sources and resting habitats, and the landscape factors dictating their resting habitat choice. Results: Resting clay pots were placed at 5 m, 25 m, 50 m, 75 m and 100 m away from isolated focal houses, radiating from them in four directions. The locations of the clay pots represent heterogeneous land cover types at a relatively fine spatial scale in the landscape. The effect of the landscape characters on the number of both female and male anophelines caught was modelled using zero-inflated negative binomial regression with a log link function. A total of 420 Anopheles mosquitoes (353 females and 67 males) belonging to three species; Anopheles arabiensis, Anopheles pharoensis, and Anopheles tenebrosus were caught in the resting clay pots, with An. arabiensis being the dominant species. Canopy cover, distance from the house, and land cover type were the significant landscape characters influencing the aggregation of resting mosquitoes. Both the count and binary models showed that canopy cover was the strongest predictor variable on the counts and the presence of Anopheles mosquitoes in the clay pots. Female Anopheles were most frequently found resting in the pots placed in banana plantations, and at sampling points that were at the greater distances (75 m and 100 m) from the focal house. Conclusions: This study showed that exophilic Anopheles mosquitoes tend to rest in shaded areas some distance away from human habitation. These findings are important when targeting mosquitoes outdoors, complementing the existing effort being made to control malaria vectors indoors.

Estimating bacteria diversity in different organs of nine species of mosquito by next generation sequencing	BMC MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						Symbionts; Mosquitoes; Metagenomics	GUT; INSECT; SYMBIONT; TRANSMISSION; MICROBIOTA; MUTUALISM; LARVAL	Background: Symbiosis in insects is accumulating significant amount of studies: the description of a wide array of mutualistic associations across the evolutionary history of insects suggests that resident microbiota acts as a driving force by affecting several aspects of hosts biology. Among arthropods, mosquito midgut microbiota has been largely investigated, providing crucial insights on the role and implications of host-symbiont relationships. However, limited amount of studies addressed their efforts on the investigation of microbiota colonizing salivary glands and reproductive tracts, crucial organs for pathogen invasion and vertical transmission of symbiotic microorganisms. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing-based approach, we analysed the microbiota of gut, salivary glands and reproductive tracts of several mosquito species, representing some of the main vectors of diseases, aiming at describing the dynamics of bacterial communities within the individual. Results: We identified a shared core microbiota between different mosquito species, although interesting inter- and intra-species differences were detected. Additionally, our results showed deep divergences between genera, underlining microbiota specificity and adaptation to their host. Conclusions: The comprehensive landscape of the bacterial microbiota components may ultimately provide crucial insights and novel targets for possible application of symbionts in innovative strategies for the control of vector borne diseases, globally named Symbiotic Control (SC), and suggesting that the holobiont of different mosquito species may significantly vary. Moreover, mosquito species are characterized by distinctive microbiota in different organs, likely reflecting different functions and/or adaptation processes.

Exploring malaria vector diversity on the Amazon Frontier	MALARIA JOURNAL			English	Article						Malaria; Species discovery; Mosquito; Anophelinae; Amazon; Deforestation	ANOPHELES NYSSORHYNCHUS BENARROCHI; AN. NYS. OSWALDOI; DIPTERA-CULICIDAE; BRAZILIAN AMAZON; PLASMODIUM-FALCIPARUM; SPECIES DELIMITATION; NUCLEOTIDE-SEQUENCES; ALBITARSIS COMPLEX; SOUTHERN COLOMBIA; NATURAL VECTORS	Background: Deforestation in the Amazon and the social vulnerability of its settler communities has been associated with increased malaria incidence. The feeding biology of the most important malaria vectors in the region, notably Nyssorhynchus darlingi, compounds efforts to control vectors and reduce transmission of what has become known as Frontier Malaria. Exploring Anophelinae mosquito diversity is fundamental to understanding the species responsible for transmission and developing appropriate management and intervention strategies for malaria control in the Amazon River basin. Methods: This study describes Anophelinae mosquito diversity from settler communities affected by Frontier Malaria in the states of Acre, Amazonas and Rondonia by analysing CO/ gene data using cluster and tree-based species delimitation approaches. Results: In total, 270 specimens from collection sites were sequenced and these were combined with 151 reference (GenBank) sequences in the analysis to assist in species identification. Conservative estimates found that the number of species collected at these sites was between 23 (mPTP partition) and 27 (strict ABGD partition) species, up to 13 of which appeared to be new. Nyssorhynchus triannulatus and Nyssorhynchus braziliensis displayed exceptional levels of intraspecific genetic diversity but there was little to no support for putative species complex status. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that Anophelinae mosquito diversity continues to be underestimated in poorly sampled areas where frontier malaria is a major public health concern. The findings will help shape future studies of vector incrimination and transmission dynamics in these areas and support efforts to develop more effective vector control and transmission reduction strategies in settler communities in the Amazon River basin.

These effects can significantly impact farmland irrigation, water transportation, and human health. However, methods for controlling its growth are not ideal, and control using biological and chemical agents can result in secondary pollution. The utilization of E. crassipes as a resource, for example, as animal feed or organic substrates, can not only turn waste into valuable resources, but it can also solve the problem of its growth, thus bringing about economic and ecological benefits. In this paper, the growth and ecological characteristics of E. crassipes, its nutrient composition, and resource utilization approaches were reviewed. The challenges associated with the large-scale utilization of E. crassipes were also analyzed in order to provide references for the control and resource utilization of the species. Regarding challenges such as the difficulty of cultivation and the high cost of harvesting and dehydrating, it is necessary to investigate the proper water surface and coverage characteristics of E. crassipes cultivation to assure adequate biomass and protect the ecological landscape. It is also necessary to evaluate the effect of E. crassipes cultivation on the health of aquatic ecosystems and the safety of the water environment in order to prevent the significant potential ecological and environmental risks. In addition, developing portable, high-efficiency facilities to promote the effectiveness of harvesting, transportation and dehydration are needed, as well as further improvement in the techniques of utilization and assessment of the economic value.

However, there is still a paucity of data on the influence of LLIN use and other factors on mosquito bionomics in different epidemiological foci. The objective of this study was to provide updated data on the evolution of vector bionomics and malaria transmission patterns in the equatorial forest region of Cameroon over the period 2000-2017, during which LLIN coverage has increased substantially. Methods: The study was conducted in Olama and Nyabessan, two villages situated in the equatorial forest region. Mosquito collections from 2016-2017 were compared to those of 2000-2001. Mosquitoes were sampled using both human landing catches and indoor sprays, and were identified using morphological taxonomic keys. Specimens belonging to the An. gambiae complex were further identified using molecular tools. Insecticide resistance bioassays were undertaken on An. gambiae to assess the susceptibility levels to both permethrin and deltamethrin. Mosquitoes were screened for Plasmodium falciparum infection and blood-feeding preference using the ELISA technique. Parasitological surveys in the population were conducted to determine the prevalence of Plasmodium infection using rapid diagnostic tests. Results: A change in the species composition of sampled mosquitoes was recorded between the 2000-2001 collections and those of 2016-2017. A drop in the density of the local primary vectors An. nili and An. moucheti in the forest region was recorded, whereas there was an increase in the density of An. gambiae (s.l.), An. marshallii, An. ziemannii and An. paludis. A change in the biting behaviour from indoor to outdoor was recorded in Olama. Very few indoor resting mosquitoes were collected. A change in the night biting cycle was recorded with mosquitoes displaying a shift from night biting to late evening/early in the night. Several mosquitoes were found positive for Plasmodium infection, thus sustaining continuous transmission of malaria in both sites. Reduction of malaria transmission in Nyabessan was lower than that seen in Olama and associated with deforestation and the construction of a dam that may have enabled a more efficient vector, An. gambiae (s.l.), to invade the area. A high level of resistance to pyrethroids (permethrin and deltamethrin) was detected for An. gambiae in both sites. High parasite prevalence was recorded in both sites, with children of 0-16 years being the most affected. In both Olama and Nyabessan, bed net usage appeared to correlate to protection against malaria infection. Conclusions: The study shows important changes in the bionomics of vector populations and malaria transmission patterns in the equatorial forest region. The changes call for more concerted efforts to address challenges such as insecticide resistance, environmental modifications or behavioural changes affecting the performance of current control measures.

To gain functional insight into the host cellular genes required for virus infection, we performed whole-blood RNA-seq, 37-plex mass cytometry of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and serum cytokine measurements of acute- and convalescent-phase samples obtained from 42 children naturally infected with CHIKV. Semi-supervised classification and clustering of single-cell events into 57 sub-communities of canonical leukocyte phenotypes revealed a monocyte-driven response to acute infection, with the greatest expansions in intermediate CD14(++)CD16(+) monocytes and an activated subpopulation of CD14(+) monocytes. Increases in acute- phase CHIKV envelope protein E2 expression were highest for monocytes and dendritic cells. Serum cytokine measurements confirmed significant acute- phase upregulation of monocyte chemoattractants. Distinct transcriptomic signatures were associated with infection timepoint, as well as convalescent-phase anti-CHIKV antibody titer, acute- phase viremia, and symptom severity. We present a multiscale network that summarizes all observed modulations across cellular and transcriptomic levels and their interactions with clinical outcomes, providing a uniquely global view of the biomolecular landscape of human CHIKV infection.

Forage Ratio Analysis of the Southern House Mosquito in College Station, Texas	VECTOR-BORNE AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES			English	Article						southern house mosquito; West Nile virus; forage ratio; reservoir capacity	WEST-NILE-VIRUS; HOST-FEEDING PATTERNS; EXPERIMENTAL-INFECTION; AVIAN HOSTS; BIRDS; CULICIDAE; DIPTERA; VECTOR; EPIDEMIOLOGY; OUTBREAK	Culex quinquefasciatus is the principal vector of West Nile virus (WNV) in the South Central United States, yet limited data on host utilization are available. We evaluated host utilization over a 3-month period in 2013 in a residential landscape in College Station, Texas. PCR sequencing of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase 1 gene permitted molecular identification of vertebrate bloodmeals to the species level. Forage ratio analysis identified bird species that were overutilized and underutilized by comparing community feeding index values to expected relative abundance values of bird species, derived from eBird data. Community feeding index values were also used in conjunction with reservoir competence data from the literature to generate reservoir capacity index values, a means of identifying relative importance of vertebrate reservoir hosts. Of 498 blood-engorged Cx. quinquefasciatus, 313 (62.9%) were identified to vertebrate species. The majority (95.5%) of bloodmeals originated from avian species with the remainder from mammals, but not humans. Northern mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos) was the principal host for mosquito feeding in June and July, but northern cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) became primary host in August. Forage ratio analysis revealed the overutilization of house finch (Haemorhous mexicanus), American robin (Turdus migratorius), northern mockingbird, northern cardinal, white-winged dove (Zenaida asiatica), and mourning dove (Zenaida macroura). Great-tailed grackle (Quiscalus mexicanus), blue jay (Cyanocitta cristata), and Carolina wren (Thryothorus ludovicianus) were under-utilized relative to availability. Reservoir capacity calculations suggested that northern mockingbird and northern cardinal were the principal amplifiers in the study area. These data identify the primary avian species contributing to the enzootic amplification of WNV in East-Central Texas and reveal that the heavy feeding on moderately competent hosts and no feeding on humans likely limit epidemics in this region.

Evaluation of resting traps to examine the behaviour and ecology of mosquito vectors in an area of rapidly changing land use in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo	PARASITES & VECTORS			English	Article						Resting behaviour; Sticky traps; Exophily; Zoonosis; Blood meal identification	PLASMODIUM-KNOWLESI; ANOPHELES-GAMBIAE; HOST-SEEKING; WUCHERERIA-BANCROFTI; MALARIA TRANSMISSION; ARBOVIRUS INFECTIONS; INCREASING INCIDENCE; FALCIPARUM-MALARIA; WESTERN KENYA; ENDEMIC AREA	Background: Widespread deforestation occurring in the tropics is hypothesized to impact the transmission of vector-borne diseases (VBD). Predicting how environmental changes will impact VBD transmission is dependent on understanding the ecology and behaviour of potential vector species outside of domestic settings. However there are few reliable sampling tools for measuring the habitat preference and host choice of mosquito vectors; with almost none suitable for sampling recently blood-fed, resting mosquitoes. This study evaluated the use of two mosquito traps: the resting bucket (RB) and sticky resting bucket (SRB) traps relative to CDC backpack aspiration (CDC) for sampling mosquitoes resting in a range of habitats representing a gradient of deforestation. Eight habitats were selected for sampling around two villages in Kudat District, Malaysian Borneo, to reflect the range of habitats available to mosquitoes in and around human dwellings, and nearby forest habitats where reservoir hosts are present: secondary forest (edge, interior and canopy); plantations (palm and rubber); and human settlements (inside, under and around houses). Results: Over 31 days, 2243 mosquitoes were collected in 5748 discrete collections. Nine mosquito genera were sampled with Aedes and Culex species being present in all habitats and most abundant. RB and CDC backpack aspiration were most efficient for sampling Culex whereas CDC backpack aspiration and SRB were most efficient for Aedes. Most Aedes identified to species level were Ae. albopictus (91%), with their abundance being highest in forest edge habitats. In contrast, Culex were most abundant under houses. Most blood-fed mosquitoes (76%) were found in human settlements; with humans and chickens being the only blood source. Conclusions: RB and SRB traps proved capable of sampling mosquitoes resting in all sampled habitats. However, sampling efficiency was generally low (c.0.1 per trap per day), necessitating traps to be deployed in high numbers for mosquito detection. None of the traps were effective for sampling zoonotic malaria vectors; however, SRB collected relatively higher numbers of the dengue vector Ae. albopictus. The higher abundance of mosquitoes in forest edge habitats indicates the potential value of these traps for investigating sylvatic dengue transmission. This study has demonstrated the merits in application of simple resting traps for characterising mosquito vector resting behaviour outside of the home.

Household-level and surrounding peri-domestic environmental characteristics associated with malaria vectors Anopheles arabiensis and Anopheles funestus along an urban-rural continuum in Blantyre, Malawi	MALARIA JOURNAL			English	Article						Urban-rural; Urban malaria; Small-scale agriculture; Vector ecology; Anopheles; Malawi	RISK-FACTORS; URBANIZATION; AFRICA; TRANSMISSION; DISTRICT; HEALTH; AREAS	Background: Malaria is increasing in some recently urbanized areas that historically were considered lower risk. Understanding what drives urban transmission is hampered by inconsistencies in how urban contexts are defined. A dichotomized urban-rural approach, based on political boundaries may misclassify environments or fail to capture local drivers of risk. Small-scale agriculture in urban or peri-urban settings has been shown to be a major risk determinant. Methods: Household-level Anopheles abundance patterns in and around Malawi's commercial capital of Blantyre ('1.9 M pop.) were analysed. Clusters (N = 64) of five houses each located at 2.5 km intervals along eight transects radiating out from Blantyre city centre were sampled during rainy and dry seasons of 2015 and 2016. Mosquito densities were measured inside houses using aspirators to sample resting mosquitoes, and un-baited CDC light traps to sample host seeking mosquitoes. Results: Of 38,895 mosquitoes captured, 91% were female and 87% were Culex spp. Anopheles females (N = 5058) were primarily captured in light traps (97%). Anopheles abundance was greater during rainy seasons. Anopheles funestus was more abundant than Anopheles arabiensis, but both were found on all transects, and had similar associations with environmental risk factors. Anopheles funestus and An. arabiensis females significantly increased with distance from the urban centre, but this trend was not consistent across all transects. Presence of small-scale agriculture was predictive of greater Anopheles spp. abundance, even after controlling for urbanicity, number of nets per person, number of under-5-year olds, years of education, and season. Conclusions: This study revealed how small-scale agriculture along a rural-to-urban transition was associated with An. arabiensis and An. funestus indoor abundances, and that indoor Anopheles density can be high within Blantyre city limits, particularly where agriculture is present. Typical rural areas with lower house density and greater distance from urban centres reflected landscapes more suitable for Anopheles reproduction and house invasion. However, similar characteristics and elevated Anopheles abundances were also found around some houses within the city limits. Thus, dichotomous designations of urban or rural can obscure important heterogeneity in the landscape of Plasmodium transmission, suggesting the need for more nuanced assessment of urban malaria risk and prevention efforts.

There is a dearth of knowledge about mosquitoes feeding preferences and their role as potential vectors of haemosporidian parasites, particularly in modified habitats. During 2013-2014 we sampled mosquitoes in five different land use types within a cloud forest matrix. From a total of 4107 adult mosquitoes, 90 were engorged. We extracted DNA from mosquito blood-meals, abdomens, and thoraxes, which belonged to seven different species. Seventeen specimens were positive for avian Plasmodium parasites. We were able to identify the blood-meal source of 10 mosquitoes, the identified vertebrate species were: Homo sapiens (Human), Sturnira hondurensis (Bat), and Bos taurus (Cow). Our results show that Culex restuans is positive for avian malaria and it is feeding on both humans and domestic animals at urban and pen-urban habitat types, where it is also an abundant species throughout the year. Furthermore, Aedes quadrivittatus, also positive for avian malaria, is feeding on humans in the well-preserved cloud forest, where this mosquito species is highly abundant. This study is the first in Mexico to provide reference data showing generalist mosquito feeding preferences and presence of avian Plasmodium at locations with different land use types.

Brazil has wetlands at different latitudes, which enables testing the influence of the ecological factors on the prevalence and diversity of haemosporidians. We identified avian haemosporidians in waterbird species in three wetlands and investigated the effects of vector habitat suitability, landscape and host characteristics on the diversity and prevalence of these parasites. Methods: We created a map with the probability of occurrence of avian haemosporidian vectors using maximum-entropy modelling based on references addressing species known to be vectors of haemosporidians in birds in Brazil. We determined the prevalence and diversity index of haemosporidians in the great egret (Ardea alba) (n = 129) and roseate spoonbill (Platalea ajaja) (n = 180) and compared the findings to data for the wood stork (Mycteria americana) (n = 199). Results: We report the first record of Plasmodium in the family Threskiornithidae: four lineages in the roseate spoonbill, which also presented one lineage of Haemoproteus. In the family Ardeidae, we found three Plasmodium lineages in the great egret. The similar habitat suitability for vectors found in three wetlands explains the pattern of haemosporidian diversity determined for great egret and wood stork populations. Comparisons of haemosporidian diversity within each waterbird species and between regions showed a higher level in the central-western roseate spoonbill population than in the northern population (P = 0.021). Removing the host effect, we discussed the results obtained in terms of characteristics of the Pantanal region. Comparisons of Plasmodium spp. prevalence among waterbird species within the same wetland showed higher level in roseate spoonbill (74%) than those found in the great egret (21%) and wood stork (11%). Excluding the environmental effect, we interpreted result focusing host characteristics that favour infection: time required for nestlings to be covered by feathers and migratory behaviour. Conclusions: The map of habitat suitability showed that wetlands located in a 30 degrees latitudinal range offer similar conditions for avian vectors species and diversity of haemosporidians. The lineages described in waterbirds were previously identified in birds of prey as Plasmodium paranucleophilum.

Vector and host communities, as well as habitat characteristics, may have important but different impacts on the prevalence, richness and evenness of vector-borne parasites. 2. We investigated the relative importance of (1) the mosquito community composition, (2) the vertebrate community composition and (3) landscape characteristics on the prevalence, richness and evenness of avian Plasmodium. We hypothesized that parasite prevalence will be more affected by vector-related parameters, while host parameters should be also important to explain Plasmodium richness and evenness. 3. We sampled 2,588 wild house sparrows (Passer domesticus) and 340,829 mosquitoes, and we performed vertebrate censuses at 45 localities in the Southwest of Spain. These localities included urban, rural and natural landscapes that were characterized by several habitat variables. 4. Twelve Plasmodium lineages were identified in house sparrows corresponding to three major clades. Variation partitioning showed that landscape characteristics explained the highest fraction of variation in all response variables (21.0%-44.8%). Plasmodium prevalence was in addition explained by vector-related variables (5.4%) and its interaction with landscape (10.2%). Parasite richness and evenness were mostly explained by vertebrate community-related variables. 5. The structuring role of landscape characteristics in vector and host communities was a key factor in determining parasite prevalence, richness and evenness, although the role of each factor differed according to the parasite parameters studied. These results show that the biotic and abiotic contexts are important to explain the transmission dynamics of mosquito-borne pathogens in the wild.

Genetic characterization revealed that MKWV is a member of the genus Phlebovirus in the family Phenuiviridae. Interestingly, MKWV is genetically distinct from other known TBPVs and shares a most recent common ancestor with mosquito/sandflyborne (insect-borne) phleboviruses. Despite its genetic similarity to insect-borne phleboviruses, the molecular footprints of its viral proteins and its biological characteristics define MKWV as a tick-borne virus that can be transmitted to mammals. A phylogenetic ancestral-state reconstruction for arthropod vectors of phleboviruses including MKWV based on viral L segment sequences indicated that ticks likely harbored ancestral phleboviruses that evolved into both the tick-borne and MKWV/insect-borne phlebovirus lineages. Overall, our findings suggest that most of the phlebovirus evolution has occurred in hard ticks to generate divergent viruses, which may provide a seminal foundation for understanding the mechanisms underlying the evolution and emergence of pathogenic phleboviruses, such as Rift Valley fever virus and SFTSV/HRTV. IMPORTANCE The emergence of novel tick-borne RNA viruses causing severe illness in humans has complicated the epidemiological landscape of tick-borne diseases, requiring further investigation to safeguard public health. In the present study, we discovered a novel tick-borne phlebovirus from lxodes persulcatus ticks in Japan. While its viral RNA genome sequences were similar to those of mosquito/sandfly-borne viruses, molecular and biological footprints confirmed that this is a tick-borne virus. The unique evolutionary position of the virus allowed us to estimate the ancestral phlebovirus vector, which was likely a hard tick. Our findings may provide a better understanding of the evolution and emergence of phleboviruses associated with emerging infectious diseases, such as severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) and Heartland virus disease.

Recent introductions in Cairns, Australia have demonstrated slower than expected spatial spread. Potential reasons for this include: (i) barriers to Ae. aegypti dispersal; (ii) higher incidence of long-range dispersal; and (iii) intergenerational loss of Wolbachia. We investigated these three potential factors using genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and an assay for the Wolbachia infection wMel in 161 Ae. aegypti collected from Cairns in 2015. We detected a small but significant barrier effect of Cairns highways on Ae. aegypti dispersal using distance-based redundancy analysis and patch-based simulation analysis. We detected a pair of putative full-siblings in ovitraps 1312 m apart, indicating long-distance female movement likely mediated by human transport. We also found a pair of full-siblings of different infection status, indicating intergenerational loss of Wolbachia in the field. These three factors are all expected to contribute to the slow spread of Wolbachia through Ae. aegypti populations, though from our results it is unclear whether Wolbachia loss and long-distance movement are sufficiently common to reduce the speed of spatial spread appreciably. Our findings inform the strategic deployment of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes during releases, and show how parameter estimates from laboratory studies may differ from those estimated using field data. Our landscape genomics approach can be extended to other host/symbiont systems that are being considered for biocontrol.

Primary blood-hosts of mosquitoes are influenced by social and ecological conditions in a complex urban landscape	PARASITES & VECTORS			English	Article						Arbovirus; Avian; Blood meal; Human; Mosquito; Rat; Vector	AEDES-ALBOPICTUS DIPTERA; CULEX-PIPIENS COMPLEX; NILE VIRUS AMPLIFICATION; VECTOR-BORNE DISEASE; J. JAPONICUS DIPTERA; LA-CROSSE VIRUS; WEST-NILE; FEEDING PATTERNS; UNITED-STATES; ENCEPHALITIS-VIRUS	Background: Temperate urban landscapes support persistent and growing populations of Culex and Aedes mosquito vectors. Large urban mosquito populations can represent a significant risk for transmission of emergent arboviral infection. However, even large mosquito populations are only a risk to the animals they bite. The purpose of this study is to identify and assess spatial patterns of host-use in a temperate urban landscape with heterogeneous socio-economic and ecological conditions. Results: Mosquito blood meals were collected from neighborhoods categorized along a socio-economic gradient in Baltimore, MD, USA. Blood meal hosts were identified for two Aedes (Ae. albopictus and Ae. japonicus) and three Culex (Cx. pipiens, Cx. restuans and Cx. salinarius) species. The brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) was the most frequently detected host in both Aedes species and Cx. salinarius. Human biting was evident in Aedes and Culex species and the proportion of human blood meals from Ae. albopictus varied significantly with neighborhood socio-economic status. Aedes albopictus was most likely to feed on human blood hosts (at 50%) in residential blocks categorized as having income above the city median, although there were still more total human bites detected from lower income blocks where Ae. albopictus was more abundant. Birds were the most frequently detected Culex blood hosts but were absent from all Aedes sampled. Conclusions: This study highlights fine-scale variation in host-use by medically important mosquito vectors and specifically investigates blood meal composition at spatial scales relevant to urban mosquito dispersal and human exposure. Further, the work emphasizes the importance of neighborhood economics and infrastructure management in shaping both the relative abundance of vectors and local blood feeding strategies. The invasive brown rat was an important blood source across vector species and neighborhoods in Baltimore. We show that social and economic conditions can be important predictors of transmission potential in urban landscapes and identify important questions about the role of rodents in supporting urban mosquito populations.

J	Walsh, MG; Webb, C				Walsh, Michael G.; Webb, Cameron			Hydrological features and the ecological niches of mammalian hosts delineate elevated risk for Ross River virus epidemics in anthropogenic landscapes in Australia	PARASITES & VECTORS			English	Article						Ross River virus; Reservoir host; Mosquito-borne; Hydrology; Australia	BARMAH FOREST VIRUSES; CLIMATE VARIABILITY; EXPERIMENTAL-INFECTION; SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS; TRICHOSURUS-VULPECULA; BRUSHTAIL POSSUMS; DISEASE; TRANSMISSION; QUEENSLAND; ARBOVIRUS	Background: The current understanding of the landscape epidemiology of Ross River virus (RRV), Australia's most common arthropod-borne pathogen, is fragmented due to gaps in surveillance programs and the relatively narrow focus of the research conducted to date. This leaves public health agencies with an incomplete understanding of the spectrum of infection risk across the diverse geography of the Australian continent. The current investigation sought to assess the risk of RRV epidemics based on abiotic and biotic landscape features in anthropogenic landscapes, with a particular focus on the influence of water and wildlife hosts. Methods: Abiotic features, including hydrology, land cover and altitude, and biotic features, including the distribution of wild mammalian hosts, were interrogated using a Maxent model to discern the landscape suitability to RRV epidemics in anthropogenically impacted environments across Australia. Results: Water-soil balance, proximity to controlled water reservoirs, and the ecological niches of four species (Perameles nasuta, Wallabia bicolor, Pseudomys novaehollandiae and Trichosurus vulpecula) were important features identifying high risk landscapes suitable for the occurrence of RRV epidemics. Conclusions: These results help to delineate human infection risk and thus provide an important perspective for geographically targeted vector, wildlife, and syndromic surveillance within and across the boundaries of local health authorities. Importantly, our analysis highlights the importance of the hydrology, and the potential role of mammalian host species in shaping RRV epidemic risk in peri-urban space. This study offers novel insight into wildlife hosts and RRV infection ecology and identifies those species that may be beneficial to future targeted field surveillance particularly in ecosystems undergoing rapid change.

Zoonotic vector-borne disease prevalence is affected by vector, human, and reservoir host factors, which are influenced by habitat and climate; these 5 components interact on microhabitat-to-landscape scales but are often analyzed at a single spatial scale. Methods. We present an information theoretic, multiscale, multiple regression analysis of the ecological drivers of Ross River virus. We analyze the spatial pattern of 20 years of Ross River virus infections from South Australia (1992-2012; n = 5261), using variables across these 5 components of disease ecology at 3 spatial scales. Results. We found that covariate importance depended on the spatial scale of the analysis; some biotic variables were more important at fine scales and some abiotic variables were more important at coarser spatial scales. The urban score of an area was most predictive of infections, and mosquito variables did not improve the explanatory power of these models. Conclusions. Through this multiscale analysis, we identified novel drivers of the spatial distribution of disease and recommend public health interventions. Our results underline that single-scale analyses may paint an incomplete picture of disease drivers, potentially creating a major flaw in epidemiological analyses. Multiscale, ecological analyses are needed to better understand infectious disease transmission.

Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) spread by Aedes mosquitoes are (re) emerging in many parts of the tropics, partially explained by changes in agricultural land-use. We explored the effects of land-use changes on the abundance, distribution, and host-seeking behavior of Aedes mosquitoes along a gradient of anthropogenic disturbance in oil palm-dominated landscapes in southeastern Cote d'Ivoire. Methodology Between January and December 2014, eggs, larvae, pupae, and adults of Aedes mosquitoes were sampled in four types of macrohabitats (rainforest, polyculture, oil palm monoculture, and rural housing areas), using standard procedures (bamboo-ovitraps, metallicovitraps, larval surveys, and human-baited double-net traps). Immature stages were reared and adult mosquitoes identified at species level. Principal findings A total of 28,276 Aedes specimens belonging to 11 species were collected. No Aedes-positive microhabitat and only four specimens of Ae. aegypti were found in oil palm monoculture. The highest abundance of Aedes mosquitoes (60.9%) was found in polyculture, while the highest species richness (11 species) was observed in rainforest. Ae. aegypti was the predominant Aedes species, and exhibited high anthropophilic behavior inflicting 93.0% of total biting to humans. The biting rate of Aedes mosquitoes was 34.6 and 7.2-fold higher in polyculture and rural housing areas, respectively, compared to rainforest. Three species (Ae. aegypti, Ae. dendrophilus, and Ae. vittatus) bit humans in polyculture and rural housing areas, with respective biting rates of 21.48 and 4.48 females/person/day. Unexpectedly, all three species were also feeding during darkness. Aedes females showed bimodal daily feeding cycles with peaks at around 08: 00 a. m. and 05: 00 p. m. Host-seeking activities were interrupted between 11: 00 a. m. and 02: 00 p. m. in rural housing areas, while no such interruption was observed in polyculture. Some rainforest-dwelling Aedes species displayed little preference to feed on humans. Conclusions In southeastern Co A te d'Ivoire, the agricultural land-use/land-cover changes due to the conversion of rainforest into oil palm monocultures influence the abundance, distribution, and host-seeking behaviors of anthropophagic and non-anthropophagic Aedes vectors. As a result, there is higher risk of humans to arbovirus transmission in polyculture and rural housing areas. There is a need for integrated vector management, including landscape epidemiology and ecotope-based vector control.	[Zahouli, Julien B.

Vertical transmission of positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses in plants as a model for arboviral induced teratogenesis	CURRENT OPINION IN VIROLOGY			English	Article							IMPRINTED GENES; ARABIDOPSIS; PROTEINS; BINDING; INFECTION; DNA; LANDSCAPE; MOSQUITOS; DISEASES; BIOLOGY	Teratogenic viruses have increased public health importance with the emergence of Zika virus and a recent decline in rubella virus vaccination. Of the seven viruses known to cause birth defects in humans, three are mosquito-borne pathogens. Ethical oversight, compliance, rising costs, and the need for specialized training slow the pace of study of these human pathogens compared to study of similar teratogenic viruses in plants. Plant viruses have served as models for human viruses which can be applied to animal systems. This review describes the similar features of plant and animal teratogenic arboviruses and the common systems and barriers that are encountered during vertical transmission in the host.

Wasps displaced within their probable foraging grounds returned to their nests on the day of release although they oriented randomly upon release; however, wasps fed before release returned sooner, displaying nest-ward orientation. When displaced to places far from their nests, thus expected to be unfamiliar, only a third returned on the day of release showing nest-ward orientation; others oriented randomly and either returned on subsequent days or never. When confined within mosquito-net tents since eclosion and later released to places close to their nests (but unfamiliar), even fed wasps oriented randomly, and only older wasps returned, taking longer time. Thus, contrary to insects inhabiting less-featured landscapes, R. marginata foragers appear to have thorough familiarity with their foraging grounds that enables them to orient and home efficiently after passive displacement. Their initial orientation is, however, determined by an interaction of the information acquired from surrounding landscape and their physiological motivation. With age, they develop skills to home from unfamiliar places. Homing behaviour in insects appears to be influenced by evolutionarily conserved mechanisms and the landscape in which they have evolved.

Analysis of nuclear and organellar genomes of Plasmodium knowlesi in humans reveals ancient population structure and recent recombination among host-specific subpopulations	PLOS GENETICS			English	Article							HUMAN MALARIA PARASITE; PENINSULAR MALAYSIA; INFECTIONS; PROTEIN; TRANSMISSION; ASSOCIATION; EVOLUTION; VECTORS; ECOLOGY; SABAH	The macaque parasite Plasmodium knowlesi is a significant concern in Malaysia where cases of human infection are increasing. Parasites infecting humans originate from genetically distinct subpopulations associated with the long-tailed (Macaca fascicularis (Mf)) or pig-tailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina (Mn)). We used a new high-quality reference genome to re-evaluate previously described subpopulations among human and macaque isolates from Malaysian-Borneo and Peninsular-Malaysia. Nuclear genomes were dimorphic, as expected, but new evidence of chromosomal-segment exchanges between subpopulations was found. A large segment on chromosome 8 originating from the Mn subpopulation and containing genes encoding proteins expressed in mosquito-borne parasite stages, was found in Mf genotypes. By contrast, non-recombining organelle genomes partitioned into 3 deeply branched lineages, unlinked with nuclear genomic dimorphism. Subpopulations which diverged in isolation have re-connected, possibly due to deforestation and disruption of wild macaque habitats. The resulting genomic mosaics reveal traits selected by host-vector-parasite interactions in a setting of ecological transition.

A metapopulation model for the population dynamics of anopheles mosquito	APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION			English	Article						Anopheles mosquito; Dispersal; Monotone system; Stability analysis; Metapopulation; Simulation	STERILE INSECT TECHNIQUE; AFRICAN MALARIA VECTORS; MATHEMATICAL-MODEL; EPIDEMIC MODEL; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; INFECTIOUS-DISEASES; GLOBAL DYNAMICS; SPREAD; HETEROGENEITY; TRANSMISSION	A more robust assessment of malaria control will come from a better understanding of the distribution and connectivity of breeding and blood feeding sites. Spatial heterogeneity of mosquito resources, such as hosts and breeding sites, affects mosquito dispersal behavior. This paper analyzes and simulates the spreading of anopheles mosquito on a complex metapopulation, that is, networks of populations connected by migratory flows whose configurations are described in terms of connectivity distribution of nodes (patches) and the conditional probabilities of connections between nodes. We examine the impacts of vector dispersal on the persistence and extinction of a mosquito population in both homogeneous and heterogeneous landscapes. For uncorrelated networks in a homogeneous landscape, we derive an explicit formula of the basic offspring number R-0((m)). Using the theory of monotone operators, we obtain sufficient conditions for the global asymptotic stability of equilibria. Precisely, the value 1 of the basic offspring number is a forward bifurcation for the dynamics of anopheles mosquito, with the trivial (mosquito-free) equilibrium point being globally asymptotically stable (GAS) when R-0((m)) > 1, and one stable nontrivial (mosquito-persistent) equilibrium point being born with well determined basins of attraction when R-0((m)) >1. Theoretical results are numerically supported and the impact of the migration of mosquitoes are discussed through global sensitivity analysis and numerical simulations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Human movement, cooperation and the effectiveness of coordinated vector control strategies	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE			English	Article						metapopulation; commuting patterns; Zika virus; Aedes aegypti; larval control	AEDES-AEGYPTI; DENGUE TRANSMISSION; SPATIAL HETEROGENEITY; BORNE DISEASES; DYNAMICS; DISPERSAL; MOSQUITOS; MODEL; ERADICATION; SURVIVAL	Vector-borne disease transmission is often typified by highly focal transmission and influenced by movement of hosts and vectors across different scales. The ecological and environmental conditions (including those created by humans through vector control programmes) that result in metapopulation dynamics remain poorly understood. The development of control strategies that would most effectively limit outbreaks given such dynamics is particularly urgent given the recent epidemics of dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses. We developed a stochastic, spatial model of vector-borne disease transmission, allowing for movement of hosts between patches. Our model is applicable to arbovirus transmission by Aedes aegypti in urban settings and was parametrized to capture Zika virus transmission in particular. Using simulations, we investigated the extent to which two aspects of vector control strategies are affected by human commuting patterns: the extent of coordination and cooperation between neighbouring communities. We find that transmission intensity is highest at intermediate levels of host movement. The extent to which coordination of control activities among neighbouring patches decreases the prevalence of infection is affected by both how frequently humans commute and the proportion of neighbouring patches that commits to vector surveillance and control activities. At high levels of host movement, patches that do not contribute to vector control may act as sources of infection in the landscape, yet have comparable levels of prevalence as patches that do cooperate. This result suggests that real cooperation among neighbours will be critical to the development of effective pro-active strategies for vector-borne disease control in today's commuter-linked communities.

Skin parasite landscape determines host infectiousness in visceral leishmaniasis	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							PHLEBOTOMINE SAND FLIES; MOSQUITO-BORNE DISEASE; LUTZOMYIA-LONGIPALPIS; HETEROGENEOUS ENVIRONMENT; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; TRANSMISSION; EPIDEMIOLOGY; PSYCHODIDAE; VECTORS; DIPTERA	Increasing evidence suggests that the infectiousness of patients for the sand fly vector of visceral leishmaniasis is linked to parasites found in the skin. Using a murine model that supports extensive skin infection with Leishmania donovani, spatial analyses at macro-(quantitative PCR) and micro-(confocal microscopy) scales indicate that parasite distribution is markedly skewed. Mathematical models accounting for this heterogeneity demonstrate that while a patchy distribution reduces the expected number of sand flies acquiring parasites, it increases the infection load for sand flies feeding on a patch, increasing their potential for onward transmission. Models representing patchiness at both macro- and micro-scales provide the best fit with experimental sand fly feeding data, pointing to the importance of the skin parasite landscape as a predictor of host infectiousness. Our analysis highlights the skin as a critical site to consider when assessing treatment efficacy, transmission competence and the impact of visceral leishmaniasis elimination campaigns.

The pattern of malaria transmission in the highland plateau ecosystems is less distinct due to the flat topography and diffuse hydrology resulting from numerous streams. The non-homogeneous distribution of larval breeding habitats in east African highlands obviously affects Anopheles spatial distribution which, consequently, leads to heterogeneous human exposure to malaria. Another delicate parameter in the fragile transmission risk of malaria in the highlands is the rapid loss of primary forest due to subsistence agriculture. The implication of this change in land cover on malaria transmission is that deforestation can lead to changes in microclimate of both adult and larval habitats hence increase larvae survival, population density, and gametocytes development in adult mosquitoes. Deforestation has been documented to enhancing vectorial capacity of Anopheles gambiae by nearly 100% compared to forested areas. Method: The study was conducted in five different ecosystems in the western Kenya highlands, two U-shaped valleys (Iguhu, Emutete), two V-shaped valleys (Marani, Fort Ternan), and one plateau (Shikondi) for 16 months among 6- to 15-year-old children. Exposure to malaria was tested using circumsporozoite protein (CSP) and merozoite surface protein immunochromatographic antibody tests. Malaria parasite was examined using different tools, which include microscopy based on blood smears, rapid diagnostic test based on HRP 2 proteins, and serology based on human immune response to parasite and vector antigens have been also examined in the highlands in comparison with different topographical systems of western Kenya. Results: The results suggested that changes in the topography had implication on transmission in highlands of western Kenya and appropriate diagnosis, treatment, and control tool needed to be considered accordingly. Both plateau and U-shaped valley found to have higher parasite density than V-shaped valley. People in V-valley were less immune than in plateau and U-valley residents. Conclusion: Topography diversity in western Kenya highlands has a significant impact on exposure rates of human to malaria vectors and parasite. The residents of V-shaped valleys are at risk of having explosive malaria outbreaks during hyper-transmission periods due to low exposure to malaria parasite; hence, they have low immune response to malaria, while the U-shaped valleys have stable malaria transmission, therefore, the human population has developed immunity to malaria due to continuous exposure to malaria.","","FRONT PUBLIC HEALTH","2296-2565",NA,"Background: It is almost an axiom that in the African highlands (above 1,500 m) transmission of Plasmodium falciparum is limited primarily by low ambient temperature and that small changes in temperature could result in temporary favorable conditions for unstable transmission within populations that have acquired little functional immunity.

Therefore, symbionts that have evolved strategies to increase their host's ability to evade lethal parasites may have high penetrance, while detrimental symbionts would be selected against, leading to lower penetrance or extinction from the host population. In a natural population of the parasitoid wasp Hyposoter horticola in the Aland Islands (Finland), the Wolbachia strain wHho persists at an intermediate prevalence (similar to 50%). Additionally, there is a negative correlation between the prevalence of Wolbachia and a hyperparasitoid wasp, Mesochorus cf. stigmaticus, in the landscape. Using a manipulative field experiment, we addressed the persistence of Wolbachia at this intermediate level, and tested whether the observed negative correlation could be due to Wolbachia inducing either susceptibility or resistance to parasitism. We show that infection with Wolbachia does not influence the ability of the wasp to parasitize its butterfly host, Melitaea cinxia, but that hyperparasitism of the wasp increases in the presence of wHho. Consequently, the symbiont is detrimental, and in order to persist in the host population, must also have a positive effect on fitness that outweighs the costly burden of susceptibility to widespread parasitism.","","J EXP BIOL","1477-9145",NA,"The success of maternally transmitted endosymbiotic bacteria, such as Wolbachia, is directly linked to their host reproduction but in direct conflict with other parasites that kill the host before it reaches reproductive maturity.

We show the existence of a globally stable steady state, and a threshold that determines whether a pathogen is either absent from all patches, or endemic and present at some level in all patches. Each patch is characterized by a local basic reproduction number, whose value predicts whether the disease is cleared or not when the patch is isolated: patches are known as demographic sinks if they have a local basic reproduction number less than one, and hence would clear the disease if isolated; patches with a basic reproduction number above one would sustain endemic infection in isolation, and become demographic sources of parasites when connected to other patches. Sources are also considered focal areas of transmission for the larger landscape, as they export excess parasites to other areas and can sustain parasite populations. We show how to determine the various basic reproduction numbers from steady state estimates in the patched network and knowledge of additional model parameters, hereby identifying parasite sources in the process. This is useful in the context of control of the infection on natural landscapes, because a commonly suggested strategy is to target focal areas, in order to make their corresponding basic reproduction numbers less than one, effectively turning them into sinks. We show that this is indeed a successful control strategy albeit a conservative and possibly expensive one in case either the human host, or the vector does not move.

Mosquito abundances and diversity were higher in sylvan habitats compared with urban areas, resulting in significantly different community compositions between the two habitats.

This is particularly apparent for mosquitoes, which use a combination of olfactory, visual, and thermal cues to locate hosts [6-10]. Mosquitoes are thought to detect suitable hosts by the presence of a sparse CO2 plume, which they track by surging upwind and casting crosswind [11]. Upon approach, local cues such as heat and skin volatiles help them identify a landing site [12-15]. Recent evidence suggests that thermal attraction is gated by the presence of CO2 [6], although this conclusion was based experiments in which the actual flight trajectories of the animals were unknown and visual cues were not studied. Using a three-dimensional tracking system, we show that rather than gating heat sensing, the detection of CO2 actually activates a strong attraction to visual features. This visual reflex guides the mosquitoes to potential hosts where they are close enough to detect thermal cues. By experimentally decoupling the olfactory, visual, and thermal cues, we show that the motor reactions to these stimuli are independently controlled. Given that humans become visible to mosquitoes at a distance of 5-15 m [16], visual cues play a critical intermediate role in host localization by coupling long-range plume tracking to behaviors that require short-range cues. Rather than direct neural coupling, the separate sensory-motor reflexes are linked as a result of the interaction between the animal's reactions and the spatial structure of the stimuli in the environment.","","CURR BIOL","1879-0445",NA,"All moving animals, including flies [1-3], sharks [4], and humans [5], experience a dynamic sensory landscape that is a function of both their trajectory through space and the distribution of stimuli in the environment.

Evaluation of local transmission epidemiology to characterize malaria risk is essential for planning malaria control and elimination programmes. The use of geographical information systems (GIS) techniques has been a major asset to this approach. To assess time and space distribution of malaria disease in Bandiagara, Mali, within a transmission season, data were used from an ongoing malaria incidence study that enrolled 300 participants aged under six years old. Methods: Children's households were georeferenced using a handheld global position system. Clinical malaria was defined as a positive blood slide for Plasmodium falciparum asexual stages associated with at least one of the following signs: headache, body aches, fever, chills and weakness. Daily rainfall was measured at the local weather station. Landscape features of Bandiagara were obtained from satellite images and field survey. QGIS (TM) software was used to map malaria cases, affected and non-affected children, and the number of malaria episodes per child in each block of Bandiagara. Clusters of high or low risk were identified under SaTScan (R) software according to a Bernoulli model. Results: From June 2009 to May 2010, 296 clinical malaria cases were recorded. Though clearly temporally related to the rains, Plasmodium falciparum occurrence persisted late in the dry season. Two hot spots of malaria transmission also found, notably along the Yame River, characterized by higher than expected numbers of malaria cases, and high numbers of clinical episodes per child. Conversely, the north-eastern sector of the town had fewer cases despite its proximity to a large body of standing water which was mosquito habitat. Conclusion: These results confirm the existence of a marked spatial heterogeneity of malaria transmission in Bandiagara, providing support for implementation of targeted interventions.

Hosts or habitats: What drives the spatial distribution of mosquitoes?

For mosquitoes, existing spatial models use only habitat elements (hydrologic and floristic) to predict the distribution of disease vectors within the landscape, ignoring the potential importance of the distribution of hosts. We tested the hypothesis that the distribution of hosts would better explain the spatial distribution of mosquitoes than habitat variables using Information Theory and Poisson Regression. We analyzed the abundance of ectotherm-biting mosquitoes and their hosts from 37 points over a 28-km(2) area in Tuskegee National Forest, Alabama, USA. We compared models built using information regarding habitat, hosts, or both for their ability to explain the abundance of Culex peccator and Culex territans, two mosquito species that specialize on reptiles and amphibians. Models built using both host and habitat information were the best models for both species, suggesting that information regarding the distribution of mosquito hosts greatly improves models of mosquito distributions. Moreover, when differences in habitat makeup among stations were accounted for, mosquitoes were found to be significantly more abundant at locations with greater host abundance. Since most mosquitoes feed on only a limited range of hosts and successful blood feeding is one of the most crucial bottlenecks in the life cycle of mosquitoes, it follows that mosquitoes would aggregate in areas of greatest host density. Habitat influences the availability of suitable larval development sites, and to some extent, distribution of hosts. Our analysis, however, shows that within the landscape the distribution of host animals is a crucial factor in determining the spatial distribution of vectors. This has clear and important implications for determining which areas are at a greater risk for zoonotic arboviruses and is a potentially transformative paradigm for understanding the factors that influence the spatial distribution of disease vectors.

These include several instances of simple mutational adaptations, often to hosts closely related to the natural reservoirs. However, based on theoretical grounds, arthropod-borne viruses, or arboviruses, may face several challenges for adaptation to new hosts. Here, we review recent findings regarding adaptive evolution of arboviruses and its impact on disease emergence. We focus on the zoonotic alphaviruses Venezuelan equine encephalitis and chikungunya viruses, which have undergone adaptive evolution that mediated recent outbreaks of disease, as well as the flaviviruses dengue and West Nile viruses, which have emerged via less dramatic adaptive mechanisms.

West Nile Virus Prevalence across Landscapes Is Mediated by Local Effects of Agriculture on Vector and Host Communities	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CULEX-TARSALIS DIPTERA; COREGIONALIZATION ANALYSIS; MULTISCALE ASSESSMENT; SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS; LARGE-SCALE; CULICIDAE; RISK; EPIDEMIOLOGY; DIVERSITY; OUTBREAKS	Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) threaten the health of humans, livestock, and wildlife. West Nile virus (WNV), the world's most widespread arbovirus, invaded the United States in 1999 and rapidly spread across the county. Although the ecology of vectors and hosts are key determinants of WNV prevalence across landscapes, the factors shaping local vector and host populations remain unclear. Here, we used spatially-explicit models to evaluate how three land-use types (orchards, vegetable/forage crops, natural) and two climatic variables (temperature, precipitation) influence the prevalence of WNV infections and vector/host distributions at landscape and local spatial scales. Across landscapes, we show that orchard habitats were associated with greater prevalence of WNV infections in reservoirs (birds) and incidental hosts (horses), while increased precipitation was associated with fewer infections. At local scales, orchard habitats increased the prevalence of WNV infections in vectors (mosquitoes) and the abundance of mosquitoes and two key reservoir species, the American robin and the house sparrow. Thus, orchard habitats benefitted WNV vectors and reservoir hosts locally, creating focal points for the transmission of WNV at landscape scales in the presence of suitable climatic conditions.

Development and evaluation of methods to assess populations of black flies (Diptera: Simuliidae) at nests of the endangered whooping crane (Grus americana)	JOURNAL OF VECTOR ECOLOGY			English	Article						Simulium; endangered species; Necedah; traps; whooping crane	AEDES-TRISERIATUS DIPTERA; DEFENSIVE BEHAVIOR; CARBON-DIOXIDE; EASTERN CHIPMUNKS; LIGHT TRAPS; MOSQUITOS; CULICIDAE; SURVEILLANCE; SPECIFICITY; SILHOUETTE	Hematophagous insects can negatively affect the reproductive success of their vertebrate hosts. To determine the influence of hematophagous insects on endangered vertebrates requires specially designed programs that minimize disturbance to the hosts and address problems associated with their small populations. We developed and evaluated a surveillance program for black flies potentially affecting a population of whooping cranes (Grus americana) introduced to central Wisconsin, U.S.A. In one of the few studies to survey host-seeking female black flies and their immature stages concurrently, we processed nearly 346,000 specimens and documented 26 species, of which only two, Simulium annulus and Simulium johannseni, were attracted to nesting whooping cranes. Attempts to assess black fly populations with artificial nests and real crane eggs were unsuccessful. Carbon-dioxide traps performed well in describing black fly taxa on the landscape. However, the number of black flies at whooping crane nests was consistently higher than the number captured in carbon-dioxide traps. The carbon-dioxide traps poorly described the presence/absence, population fluctuations, and periodicity of black flies at whooping crane nests. The weak performance of the carbon-dioxide traps might have resulted from microhabitat differences between trap locations and nests or from Simulium annulus and Simulium johannseni using sensory cues in addition to carbon dioxide to find hosts. Choice of trapping techniques, therefore, depends on the information required for the particular study objectives.

There are numerous important vector species, with variable geographic ranges and ecologies, considered crucial to the transmission of WNV in the coterminous United States. To date there has been a lack of a systematic investigation in the United States, at a regional scale, of the wide variety of landscape, land use, and demographic influences on WNV incidence. In this study, we use published vector species distribution maps, as well as prominent landscape features, to define six distinct regions of the coterminous United States. We relate data on demographic, landscape, and land use conditions to the incidence of human WNV by region recorded at county level in the coterminous United States from 2002-2009. The observed relationships varied by region with the Great Plains, Northwest, and Southwest regions showing high WNV incidence associated with rural irrigated landscapes, indicating the importance of Culex tarsalis as the primary vector. In the Southeast, the percent of the population in poverty was positively associated with high WNV incidence, potentially indicating the quality of housing in relation to the vector Culex quinquefasciatus, a mosquito that often feeds indoors. The Northeast region human WNV incidence was positively associated with agricultural landscapes, potentially implying the importance of Culex restuans in a region generally thought of as being dominated by Culex pipiens transmission. There was strong spatial autocorrelation in most of the regions, but with a spatial autologistic term accounted for in binary logistic regression models, there were significant landscape, land use, and demographic covariates for each region.

With increasing urbanization and the resulting emergence of zoonotic diseases, it is critical to understand the relationships among birds, vectors, zoonotic pathogens, and the urban landscape. Here, we use wild birds as sentinels across a gradient of urbanization to understand the relative risk of diseases caused by three types of zoonotic pathogens: Salmonella pathogens, mosquito-borne West Nile virus (WNV) and tick-borne pathogens, including the agents of Lyme disease and human anaplasmosis. Wild birds were captured using mist nets at five sites throughout greater Chicago, Illinois, and blood, faecal and ectoparasite samples were collected for diagnostic testing. A total of 289 birds were captured across all sites. A total of 2.8% of birds harboured Ixodes scapularis the blacklegged tick of which 54.5% were infected with the agent of Lyme disease, and none were infected with the agent of human anaplasmosis. All infested birds were from a single site that was relatively less urban. A single bird, captured at the only field site in which supplemental bird feeding was practised within the mist netting zone, was infected with Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica. While no birds harboured WNV in their blood, 3.5% of birds were seropositive, and birds from more urban sites had higher exposure to the virus than those from less urban sites. Our results demonstrate the presence of multiple bird-borne zoonotic pathogens across a gradient of urbanization and provide an assessment of potential public health risks to the high-density human populations within the area.

Losing identity: structural diversity of transposable elements belonging to different classes in the genome of Anopheles gambiae	BMC GENOMICS			English	Article						Transposable elements; LTR; Non-LTR; Class II; Deterioration; Anopheles gambiae	DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER; LTR RETROTRANSPOSONS; DNA LOSS; EVOLUTIONARY DYNAMICS; REGULATORY SEQUENCES; MALARIA MOSQUITO; TY3/GYPSY GROUP; WHITE GENE; FAMILIES; TARGET	Background: Transposable elements (TEs), both DNA transposons and retrotransposons, are genetic elements with the main characteristic of being able to mobilize and amplify their own representation within genomes, utilizing different mechanisms of transposition. An almost universal feature of TEs in eukaryotic genomes is their inability to transpose by themselves, mainly as the result of sequence degeneration (by either mutations or deletions). Most of the elements are thus either inactive or non-autonomous. Considering that the bulk of some eukaryotic genomes derive from TEs, they have been conceived as TE graveyards. It has been shown that once an element has been inactivated, it progressively accumulates mutations and deletions at neutral rates until completely losing its identity or being lost from the host genome; however, it has also been shown that these neutral sequences might serve as raw material for domestication by host genomes. Results: We have analyzed the sequence structural variations, nucleotide divergence, and pattern of insertions and deletions of several superfamilies of TEs belonging to both class I (long terminal repeats [LTRs] and non-LTRs [NLTRs]) and II in the genome of Anopheles gambiae, aiming at describing the landscape of deterioration of these elements in this particular genome. Our results describe a great diversity in patterns of deterioration, indicating lineage-specific differences including the presence of Solo-LTRs in the LTR lineage, 5'-deleted NLTRs, and several non-autonomous and MITEs in the class II families. Interestingly, we found fragments of NLTRs corresponding to the RT domain, which preserves high identity among them, suggesting a possible remaining genomic role for these domains. Conclusions: We show here that the TEs in the An. gambiae genome deteriorate in different ways according to the class to which they belong. This diversity certainly has implications not only at the host genomic level but also at the amplification dynamic and evolution of the TE families themselves.

J	Zhu, LD; Ketola, T				Zhu, Liandong; Ketola, Tarja			Microalgae production as a biofuel feedstock: risks and challenges	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY			English	Article						microalgae production; biofuel; impact; risk; challenge	CLIMATE-CHANGE; BIODIESEL PRODUCTION; WASTE-WATER; BIOMASS; BIODIVERSITY; ECOSYSTEMS; PHOSPHORUS; NITROGEN; RECHARGE; REMOVAL	From a sustainability perspective, the potential risks associated with microalgae production for biofuel extraction will be investigated in this paper, including the environmental, economic, social and cultural dimensions. Environmentally, four main concerns are mapped out: first, there are potential water safety risks, such as water resource abuse, water pollution and groundwater recharge deficiency; second, unreasonable construction will lead to land-use overexpansion, land pollution and service expectancy reduction; third, microalgae production may exert a detrimental effect on the local ecosystem, causing algal blooms and biological invasion; finally, microalgae might emit unexpected greenhouse gases [nitrogen oxides (NO x ), methane (CH4)] and ammonia (NH3). From an economic risk standpoint, microalgae production requires an overwhelming investment due to the expensive start-up and operation. Socially, contaminant discharge will threaten the health of local animals and people. Moreover, the safety effects of genetically modified algae may not be immediately apparent or known. In addition, over time, microalgae may become a medium for mosquitoes to spread disease. From a cultural point of view, it requires time for people in developing countries to adapt algal oil to their daily life as an alternative to conventional fossil fuels. Furthermore, personnel changes in the workforce may harm existing cultural structures, and landscape aesthetics may be affected by system construction. Taking the above challenges into consideration, efficient government policies, proactive company behaviours and positive public participation will play an important role in minimising or even eliminating these potential risks.

Mosquito-borne flaviviruses have been isolated and characterized in Northern Italy: West Nile virus and Usutu virus were detected in mosquitoes and in different host species and recent studies provided evidence about the circulation of insect Flavivirus strains. Methods: In order to clarify the diffusion and the distribution of the mosquito-transmitted flaviviruses in Italy, we analyzed Culex and Ochlerotatus mosquitoes collected in 2009 and 2010 in an area divided evenly between hills and plains and where the landscape is dominated by mixed agricultural patches, rice fields, deciduous tree forests, and urban environments. Each mosquito pool was tested for the presence of Flavivirus strains and we characterized positive samples by genetic sequencing. Results: Positive mosquito pools revealed low infection prevalence, but suggested a continuous circulation of both Usutu virus and insect Flavivirus. Interestingly, phylogenetic analyses based on NS5 gene partial sequences showed a closer relationship among new Usutu virus strains from Piedmont and the reference sequences from the Eastern Europe, with respect to Italian samples characterized so far. Moreover, NS5 gene phylogeny suggested that mosquito flaviviruses found in Italy could belong to different lineages. Conclusions: Our results contribute to a wider point of view on the heterogeneity of viruses infecting mosquitoes suggesting a taxonomical revision of the Mosquito-borne Flavivirus group.

This study analyzed the spatial patterns of human WNV cases in three areas in South Dakota during 2003-2007 and investigated the influences of land cover, hydrology, soils, irrigation, and elevation by using case-control models. Land cover, hydrology, soils, and elevation all influenced WNV risk, although the main drivers were different in each study area. Risk for WNV was generally higher in areas with rural land cover than in developed areas, and higher close to wetlands or soils with a high ponding frequency. In western South Dakota, WNV risk also decreased with increasing elevation and was higher in forested areas. Our results showed that the spatial patterns of human WNV risk were associated with landscape-level features that likely reflect variability in mosquito ecology, avian host communities, and human activity.

We examine interactions of these aliens with their new environments in the context of rapid global change linked to human activity. We consider effects of such interactions on establishment and spread of the alien species and effects on indigenous biota and ecosystems. Major elements of global change that affect alien-environment interactions include landscape modifications by humans (e.g., cultivation, habitat loss and fragmentation) and increases in atmospheric CO2 and other gases resulting in climate change and other effects (e.g., changes in food quality for herbivores that affect higher trophic levels as well). Alien arthropod predators can alter landscapes for their benefit, to the detriment of indigenous species. A brief review also of blood-feeding alien arthropods makes clear that interactions with the environment critically influence invasions of zoophagous arthropods in general.

Decelerating Spread of West Nile Virus by Percolation in a Heterogeneous Urban Landscape	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							TRAVELING-WAVES; VACCINATION STRATEGIES; CULEX-QUINQUEFASCIATUS; INFECTIOUS-DISEASES; VECTOR COMPETENCE; YELLOW-FEVER; TRANSMISSION; POPULATIONS; MOSQUITOS; MODELS	Vector-borne diseases are emerging and re-emerging in urban environments throughout the world, presenting an increasing challenge to human health and a major obstacle to development. Currently, more than half of the global population is concentrated in urban environments, which are highly heterogeneous in the extent, degree, and distribution of environmental modifications. Because the prevalence of vector-borne pathogens is so closely coupled to the ecologies of vector and host species, this heterogeneity has the potential to significantly alter the dynamical systems through which pathogens propagate, and also thereby affect the epidemiological patterns of disease at multiple spatial scales. One such pattern is the speed of spread. Whereas standard models hold that pathogens spread as waves with constant or increasing speed, we hypothesized that heterogeneity in urban environments would cause decelerating travelling waves in incipient epidemics. To test this hypothesis, we analysed data on the spread of West Nile virus (WNV) in New York City (NYC), the 1999 epicentre of the North American pandemic, during annual epizootics from 2000-2008. These data show evidence of deceleration in all years studied, consistent with our hypothesis. To further explain these patterns, we developed a spatial model for vector-borne disease transmission in a heterogeneous environment. An emergent property of this model is that deceleration occurs only in the vicinity of a critical point. Geostatistical analysis suggests that NYC may be on the edge of this criticality. Together, these analyses provide the first evidence for the endogenous generation of decelerating travelling waves in an emerging infectious disease. Since the reported deceleration results from the heterogeneity of the environment through which the pathogen percolates, our findings suggest that targeting control at key sites could efficiently prevent pathogen spread to remote susceptible areas or even halt epidemics.

We compared abundance of vector species between urban and suburban neighborhoods of Henrico County, VA, in relation to the following factors: temperature, precipitation, canopy cover, building footprint, and proximity to drainage infrastructure. Mosquitoes were collected throughout the 2005, 2006, and 2007 seasons and tested for West Nile virus (WNV) in pools of 10-50. Test results of mosquito pools were compared to average site abundance from 37 sites in Henrico County, VA; abundance was then examined in relation to ecological variables. Urban infrastructure was positively correlated with the abundance of Culex pipiens L./Cx. restuans, and our findings implicate combined sewer overflow systems as large contributors to Culex vector populations. No measure of urbanization examined in our study was correlated with Aedes albopictus abundance. Our study showed that certain landscape variables identified using Geographic Information Systems are valuable for predicting primary WNV vector abundance in Virginia, and that temperature along with low precipitation are strong predictors of population growth. Our results support other regional studies that found WNV proliferates under drought conditions. Journal of Vector Ecology 36 (1): 75-85. 2011.

The numbers of females collected per trap night at traps along the ecotone of Eucalyptus stands with and without a heron colony were always greater or equal to numbers collected at traps within or under canopy. No Cx. tarsalis were collected within or under Eucaplytus canopy during the peak heron nesting season, even though these birds frequently were infected with West Nile virus and large number of engorged females could be collected at resting boxes. These data indicate a diversion of host-seeking females from traps to nesting birds reducing sampling efficiency.

With regard to health, the approach consists of systems analysis using a set of powerful tools aimed at the reduction of community vulnerability through improved public policies. The north-oriental malaria focus, one of five such foci in Venezuela, situated in the north-eastern part of the Estado Sucre state, unites several social and environmental features and functions as an epidemiological corridor, i.e. an endemic zone characterised by permanent interaction between the mosquito vector and the human host allowing a continuous persistence of the malaria lifecycle. A GIS was developed based on official cartography with thematic overlays depicting malaria distribution, socio-economic conditions, basic environmental information and specific features associated with the natural wetlands present in the area. Generally, malaria foci are continuously active but when the malaria situation was modelled in the north-oriental focus, a differential, spatio-temporal distribution pattern situation was found, i.e. a situation oscillating between very active and dormant transmission. This pattern was displayed by spatial and statistical analysis based on the model generated in this study and the results were confirmed by municipal and county malaria records. Control of malaria, keeping the incidence at a permanently low level within the regional population, should be possible if these results are taken into account when designing and implementing epidemiological surveillance policies.

Ecology and Transmission of Buruli Ulcer Disease: A Systematic Review	PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES			English	Review							REAL-TIME PCR; MYCOBACTERIUM-ULCERANS; RISK-FACTORS; ENVIRONMENTAL-SAMPLES; MACROLIDE TOXIN; SOUTHEASTERN AUSTRALIA; REDUCTIVE EVOLUTION; FEEDING-BEHAVIOR; NORTH QUEENSLAND; AQUATIC INSECTS	Buruli ulcer is a neglected emerging disease that has recently been reported in some countries as the second most frequent mycobacterial disease in humans after tuberculosis. Cases have been reported from at least 32 countries in Africa (mainly west), Australia, Southeast Asia, China, Central and South America, and the Western Pacific. Large lesions often result in scarring, contractual deformities, amputations, and disabilities, and in Africa, most cases of the disease occur in children between the ages of 4-15 years. This environmental mycobacterium, Mycobacterium ulcerans, is found in communities associated with rivers, swamps, wetlands, and human-linked changes in the aquatic environment, particularly those created as a result of environmental disturbance such as deforestation, dam construction, and agriculture. Buruli ulcer disease is often referred to as the mysterious disease because the mode of transmission remains unclear, although several hypotheses have been proposed. The above review reveals that various routes of transmission may occur, varying amongst epidemiological setting and geographic region, and that there may be some role for living agents as reservoirs and as vectors of M. ulcerans, in particular aquatic insects, adult mosquitoes or other biting arthropods. We discuss traditional and non-traditional methods for indicting the roles of living agents as biologically significant reservoirs and/or vectors of pathogens, and suggest an intellectual framework for establishing criteria for transmission. The application of these criteria to the transmission of M. ulcerans presents a significant challenge.

Planning for Rift Valley fever virus: use of geographical information systems to estimate the human health threat of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus)-related transmission	GEOSPATIAL HEALTH			English	Article						haemorrhagic fevers; viral prevention and control; bioterrorism; Rift Valley fever; deer; Culicidae; USA	WEST-NILE-VIRUS; DOMESTIC-ANIMALS; FEEDING PATTERNS; NORTHEAST OHIO; KENYA; OUTBREAK; DISEASE; EPIDEMIC; WILDLIFE; RISK	Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus is a mosquito-borne phlebovirus of the Bunyaviridae family that causes frequent outbreaks of severe animal and human disease in sub-Saharan Africa, Egypt and the Arabian Peninsula. Based on its many known competent vectors, its potential for transmission via aerosolization, and its progressive spread from East Africa to neighbouring regions, RVF is considered a high-priority, emerging health threat for humans, livestock and wildlife in all parts of the world. Introduction of West Nile virus to North America has shown the potential for exotic viral pathogens to become embedded in local ecological systems. While RVF is known to infect and amplify within domestic livestock, such as taurine cattle, sheep and goats, if RVF virus is accidentally or intentionally introduced into North America, an important unknown factor will be the role of local wildlife in the maintenance or propagation of virus transmission. We examined the potential impact of RVF transmission via white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in a typical north-eastern United States urban-suburban landscape, where livestock are rare but where these potentially susceptible, ungulate wildlife are highly abundant. Model results, based on overlap of mosquito, human and projected deer densities, indicate that a significant proportion (497/1186 km(2), i.e. 42%) of the urban and peri-urban landscape could be affected by RVF transmission during the late summer months. Deer population losses, either by intervention for herd reduction or by RVF-related mortality, would substantially reduce these likely transmission zones to 53.1 km(2), i.e. by 89%.

J	Lourenco, J; Recker, M				Lourenco, Jose; Recker, Mario			Viral and Epidemiological Determinants of the Invasion Dynamics of Novel Dengue Genotypes	PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES			English	Article							ANTIBODY-DEPENDENT ENHANCEMENT; HEMORRHAGIC-FEVER; AEDES-AEGYPTI; RISK-FACTORS; VIRUS; INFECTION; SELECTION; EMERGENCE; EVOLUTION; THAILAND	Background: Dengue has become a major concern for international public health. Frequent epidemic outbreaks are believed to be driven by a complex interplay of immunological interactions between its four co-circulating serotypes and large fluctuations in mosquito densities. Viral lineage replacement events, caused for example by different levels of cross-protection or differences in viral fitness, have also been linked to a temporary change in dengue epidemiology. A major replacement event was recently described for South-East Asia where the Asian-1 genotype of dengue serotype 2 replaced the resident Asian/American type. Although this was proposed to be due to increased viral fitness in terms of enhanced human-to-mosquito transmission, no major change in dengue epidemiology could be observed. Methods/Results: Here we investigate the invasion dynamics of a novel, advantageous dengue genotype within a model system and determine the factors influencing the success and rate of fixation as well as their epidemiological consequences. We find that while viral fitness overall correlates with invasion success and competitive exclusion of the resident genotype, the epidemiological landscape plays a more significant role for successful emergence. Novel genotypes can thus face high risks of stochastic extinction despite their fitness advantage if they get introduced during episodes of high dengue prevalence, especially with respect to that particular serotype. Conclusion: The rarity of markers for positive selection has often been explained by strong purifying selection whereby the constraints imposed by dengue's two-host cycle are expected to result in a high rate of deleterious mutations. Our results demonstrate that even highly beneficial mutants are under severe threat of extinction, which would suggest that apart from purifying selection, stochastic effects and genetic drift beyond seasonal bottlenecks are equally important in shaping dengue's viral ecology and evolution.

Vectors and malaria transmission in deforested, rural communities in north-central Vietnam	MALARIA JOURNAL			English	Article							ANOPHELES-DIRUS COMPLEX; MOLECULAR-IDENTIFICATION; PLASMODIUM-VIVAX; SEASONAL ABUNDANCE; MOSQUITOS DIPTERA; HOST PREFERENCE; BITING ACTIVITY; FOREST MALARIA; LAO PDR; CULICIDAE	Background: Malaria is still prevalent in rural communities of central Vietnam even though, due to deforestation, the primary vector Anopheles dirus is uncommon. In these situations little is known about the secondary vectors which are responsible for maintaining transmission. Basic information on the identification of the species in these rural communities is required so that transmission parameters, such as ecology, behaviour and vectorial status can be assigned to the appropriate species. Methods: In two rural villages - Khe Ngang and Hang Chuon - in Truong Xuan Commune, Quang Binh Province, north central Vietnam, a series of longitudinal entomological surveys were conducted during the wet and dry seasons from 2003 - 2007. In these surveys anopheline mosquitoes were collected in human landing catches, paired human and animal bait collections, and from larval surveys. Specimens belonging to species complexes were identified by PCR and sequence analysis, incrimination of vectors was by detection of circumsporozoite protein using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: Over 80% of the anopheline fauna was made up of Anopheles sinensis, Anopheles aconitus, Anopheles harrisoni, Anopheles maculatus, Anopheles sawadwongporni, and Anopheles philippinensis. PCR and sequence analysis resolved identification issues in the Funestus Group, Maculatus Group, Hyrcanus Group and Dirus Complex. Most species were zoophilic and while all species could be collected biting humans significantly higher densities were attracted to cattle and buffalo. Anopheles dirus was the most anthropophilic species but was uncommon making up only 1.24% of all anophelines collected. Anopheles sinensis, An. aconitus, An. harrisoni, An. maculatus, An. sawadwongporni, Anopheles peditaeniatus and An. philippinensis were all found positive for circumsporozoite protein. Heterogeneity in oviposition site preference between species enabled vector densities to be high in both the wet and dry seasons allowing for year round transmission. Conclusions: In rural communities in north central Vietnam, malaria transmission was maintained by a number of anopheline species which though collected feeding on humans were predominantly zoophilic, this behaviour allows for low level but persistent malaria transmission. The important animal baits - cattle and buffalo - were kept in the village and barrier spraying around these animals may be more effective at reducing vector densities and longevity than the currently used indoor residual spraying.

The Selection Landscape of Malaria Parasites	SCIENCE			English	Review							PLASMODIUM-FALCIPARUM MALARIA; RETROSPECTIVE EXAMINATION; REPRODUCTIVE RESTRAINT; ANTIGENIC DIVERSITY; PATHOGEN VIRULENCE; CLINICAL IMMUNITY; HOST ERYTHROCYTE; DRUG-RESISTANCE; GENOME; GENE	Malaria parasites have to survive and transmit within a highly selective and ever-changing host environment. Because immunity to malaria is nonsterilizing and builds up slowly through repeated infections, commonly the parasite invades a host that is immunologically and physiologically different from its previous host. During the course of infection, the parasite must also keep pace with changes in host immune responses and red-blood-cell physiology. Here, we describe the selection landscape of the most virulent of the human malaria parasites, Plasmodium falciparum, and the adaptive mechanisms it uses to navigate through that landscape. Taking a cost-benefit view of parasite fitness, we consider the evolutionary outcomes of the most important forces of selection operating on the parasite, namely immunity, host death, drugs, mosquito availability, and coinfection. Given the huge potential for malaria parasite evolution in the context of the recently renewed effort to eradicate malaria, a deeper understanding of P. falciparum adaptation is essential.

Prevalence values were tested for correlation with a large number of environmental variables, as modeled from weather station data and measured by satellite-borne sensors. Predictions were made based on the expected effects of climatic and landscape variables on sustained populations of arthropod vectors required for transmission of microfilariae. In general, findings were consistent with predictions in both cormorants and penguins; prevalence correlated positively with temperature, precipitation, and vegetation density, and negatively with measures of environmental variability. Resulting correlates were used to derive predictive distributions of prevalence values in cormorants throughout the archipelago. Evidence is presented implicating the mosquito Aedes taeniorhynchus as a likely vector. Knowledge of environmental variables that predict risk of disease transmission by arthropod vectors may be useful in control measures should novel pathogens be introduced to the ecosystem.

Influence of the spatial distribution of human hosts and large size containers on the dispersal of the mosquito Aedes aegypti within the first gonotrophic cycle	MEDICAL AND VETERINARY ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						dengue; dispersal; host density; landscape; larval habitat container; spatial analysis	RIO-DE-JANEIRO; DIPTERA; CULICIDAE; POPULATIONS; MOVEMENT	It is generally accepted that Aedes aegypti (L.) (Diptera: Culicidae) has a short dispersal capacity, and that displacement can be influenced by the availability of oviposition sites in the surroundings of emergence or release sites. In the present article, we observed the influence of spatial heterogeneity of large containers and human hosts on the cumulative flight direction of Ae. aegypti females during the first gonotrophic cycle, testing the hypothesis that they aggregate in resource-rich areas, i.e. where there are higher concentrations of large containers and/or humans per habitation. We analysed data from pupal surveys and mark-release-recapture experiments (non-blood-fed females were released) carried out in two dengue endemic neighbourhoods of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil: Tubiacanga (a suburb, with a human density of 337 inhabitants/ha) and Favela do Amorim (a slum, with a human density of 901 inhabitants/ha). In both areas, host-seeking females of three different release cohorts showed an overall non-uniform and extensive dispersal from their release point within 1-2 days post-release. At 4-5 days post-release, when many of the released females would be expected to be gravid, in Tubiacanga most mosquitoes were collected in areas with a relatively higher density of containers/premise, independently of the density of residents/house, whereas in Favela do Amorim, almost half of the captured mosquitoes were collected in relatively resource-poorer areas. Although Ae. aegypti dispersal patterns varied between sites, overall the distances travelled from the release point and the cumulative flight directions were correlated with the density of containers and hosts, more markedly in Tubiacanga than in Favela do Amorim.

Blood feeding patterns of mosquitoes: random or structured?	FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY			English	Article							WEST-NILE-VIRUS; AEDES-ALBOPICTUS DIPTERA; ANOPHELES-GAMBIAE S.S.; IXODES-DAMMINI ACARI; FLORIDA MOSQUITOS; CULEX-NIGRIPALPUS; DOMESTIC-ANIMALS; HOST SIZE; CULICIDAE; IDENTIFICATION	Background: The foraging behavior of blood-sucking arthropods is the defining biological event shaping the transmission cycle of vector-borne parasites. It is also a phenomenon that pertains to the realm of community ecology, since blood-feeding patterns of vectors can occur across a community of vertebrate hosts. Although great advances in knowledge of the genetic basis for blood-feeding choices have been reported for selected vector species, little is known about the role of community composition of vertebrate hosts in determining such patterns. Methods & Results: Here, we present an analysis of feeding patterns of vectors across a variety of locations, looking at foraging patterns of communities of mosquitoes, across communities of hosts primarily comprised of mammals and birds. Using null models of species co-occurrence, which do not require ancillary information about host abundance, we found that blood-feeding patterns were aggregated in studies from multiple sites, but random in studies from a single site. This combination of results supports the idea that mosquito species in a community may rely primarily on host availability in a given landscape, and that contacts with specific hosts will be influenced more by the presence/absence of hosts than by innate mosquito choices. This observation stresses the importance of blood-feeding plasticity as a key trait explaining the emergence of many zoonotic mosquito transmitted diseases. Discussion: From an epidemiological perspective our observations support the idea that phenomena promoting synchronization of vectors and hosts can promote the emergence of vector-borne zoonotic diseases, as suggested by observations on the linkages between deforestation and the emergence of several human diseases.

Landscape Epidemiology of Vector-Borne Diseases	ANNUAL REVIEW OF ENTOMOLOGY	Annual Review of Entomology		English	Review; Book Chapter						vector; host; pathogen; climate; spatial dynamics; nidus; refugia	WEST-NILE-VIRUS; LOUIS ENCEPHALITIS-VIRUS; CULEX-TARSALIS DIPTERA; GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; NORTHEASTERN UNITED-STATES; IXODES-DAMMINI ACARI; LYME-DISEASE; COACHELLA VALLEY; NEW-YORK; SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA	Landscape epidemiology describes how the temporal dynamics of host, vector, and pathogen populations interact spatially within a permissive environment to enable transmission. The spatially defined focus, or nidus, of transmission may be characterized by vegetation as well as by climate, latitude, elevation, and geology. The ecological complexity, dimensions, and temporal stability of the nidus are determined largely by pathogen natural history and vector bionomics. Host populations, transmission efficiency, and therefore pathogen amplification vary spatially, thereby creating a heterogeneous surface that may be defined by remote sensing and statistical tools. The current review describes the evolution of landscape epidemiology as a science and exemplifies selected aspects by contrasting the ecology of two different recent disease outbreaks in North America caused by West Nile virus, ail explosive, highly virulent mosquito-borne virus producing ephemeral nidi, and Borrelia burgdorferi, a slowly amplifying chronic pathogen producing semipermanent nidi.

Predicting the impact of insecticide-treated bed nets on malaria transmission: the devil is in the detail	MALARIA JOURNAL			English	Article							ANOPHELES-GAMBIAE; IMPREGNATED BEDNETS; MOSQUITOS DIPTERA; ATTRACTION; CULICIDAE; RANGE; TANZANIA; EFFICACY; BAITS; AREA	Background: Insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs), including long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs), play a primary role in global campaigns to roll back malaria in tropical Africa. Effectiveness of treated nets depends on direct impacts on individual mosquitoes including killing and excite-repellency, which vary considerably among vector species due to variations in host-seeking behaviours. While monitoring and evaluation programmes of ITNs have focuses on morbidity and all-cause mortality in humans, local entomological context receives little attention. Without knowing the dynamics of local vector species and their responses to treated nets, it is difficult to predict clinical outcomes when ITN applications are scaled up across African continent. Sound model frameworks incorporating intricate interactions between mosquitoes and treated nets are needed to develop the predictive capacity for scale-up applications of ITNs. Methods: An established agent-based model was extended to incorporate the direct outcomes, e. g. killing and avoidance, of individual mosquitoes exposing to ITNs in a hypothetical village setting with 50 houses and 90 aquatic habitats. Individual mosquitoes were tracked throughout the life cycle across the landscape. Four levels of coverage, i.e. 40, 60, 80 and 100%, were applied at the household level with treated houses having only one bed net. By using Latin hypercube sampling scheme, parameters governing killing, diverting and personal protection of net users were evaluated for their relative roles in containing mosquito populations, entomological inoculation rates (EIRs) and malaria incidence. Results: There were substantial gaps in coverage between households and individual persons, and 100% household coverage resulted in circa 50% coverage of the population. The results show that applications of ITNs could give rise to varying impacts on population-level metrics depending on values of parameters governing interactions of mosquitoes and treated nets at the individual level. The most significant factor in determining effectiveness was killing capability of treated nets. Strong excito-repellent effect of impregnated nets might lead to higher risk exposure to non-bed net users. Conclusion: With variabilities of vector mosquitoes in host-seeking behaviours and the responses to treated nets, it is anticipated that scale-up applications of INTs might produce varying degrees of success dependent on local entomological and epidemiological contexts. This study highlights that increased ITN coverage led to significant reduction in risk exposure and malaria incidence only when treated nets yielded high killing effects. It is necessary to test efficacy of treated nets on local dominant vector mosquitoes, at least in laboratory, for monitoring and evaluation of ITN programmes.

Human intrusion into these former remote habitats through deforestation and bush meat hunting leads to an increased contact between humans and wildlife, and between humans and insect vectors (Leendertz et al., 2006; Jones et al., 2008; Gillespie et al., 2009). In the course of our research on pathogen transmission in this type of ecosystem, samples from non-human primates and other nammalian hosts living in tropical rainforests as well as humans living around rainforests are collected and analysed at the Robert Koch-Institut. One of the aims of our studies is to evaluate the risk of emergence of new zoonoses in the human population. We specifically focus on screening humans with high exposure to blood and organs of wild primates through bushmeat hunting and handling, but pathogen transmission from other possible hosts are also analysed. Chimpanzees can be seen as a natural system to study disease transmission among primates. In the last years we have shown that simian retroviruses, such as the Simian T-Cell Leukemia Virus-1 (STLV-1) and Foamy-Viruses (SFV) are transmitted from one non-human primate to another. Based on molecular epidemiological findings as well as prevalence data in different age classes of wild chimpanzees, we could show that the main transmission of these viruses is through the hunter-prey relationship that exists between red colobus monkeys and chimpanzees (Leendertz et al., 2004a, b; Leendertz et al., 2008). These findings in wild primates, which are known to be hunted by humans, inspired us to perform a study focused on the human population in the area together with the Institut Pasteur Cote d'Ivoire, and we found evidence of virus transmission from non-human primates to humans. Furthermore, we investigated several outbreaks of respiratory diseases in wild chimpanzees. In necropsy samples from deceased chimpanzees we detected two new strains of S. pneumoniae (Chi et al., 2007). In addition, the chimpanzees were infected with human paramyxoviruses (Kondgen et al., 2008). This was the first description of anthropoozonotic transmission of human respiratory viruses to great apes, identifying that human diseases are an important threat to these endangered species. In order to investigate the influence of ecological changes on the prevalence of mosquitoes and arboviruses, we systematically captured mosquitoes in and around tropical rainforests with different degrees of ecological changes. Firstly, we detected new viruses of the families Flavi-, Bunya- and Coronaviruses (Junglen et al., 2009), Secondly, we could show that ecological changes had a dramatic influence on the distribution and prevalence of mosquito and viruses, indicating that disturbance of the rainforest increases the risk of transmission of arboviruses to the human population (Junglen et al., in print).

Prevalence and diversity patterns of avian blood parasites in degraded African rainforest habitats	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						Andropadus latirostris; Cameroon; Cyanomitra olivacea; deforestation; Haemoproteus; Leucocytozoon; malaria; Plasmodium	CYTOCHROME-B LINEAGES; VECTOR-BORNE DISEASE; MALARIA PARASITES; HOST-SPECIFICITY; TRADE-OFFS; EVOLUTIONARY RELATIONSHIPS; HAEMOSPORIDIAN PARASITES; ECOLOGICAL IMMUNOLOGY; MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; MOSQUITO VECTOR	Land use changes including deforestation, road construction and agricultural encroachments have been linked to the increased prevalence of several infectious diseases. In order to better understand how deforestation affects the prevalence of vector-borne infectious diseases in wildlife, nine paired sites were sampled (disturbed vs. undisturbed habitats) in Southern Cameroon. We studied the diversity, prevalence and distribution of avian malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp.) and other related haemosporidians (species of Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon) from these sites in two widespread species of African rainforest birds, the yellow-whiskered greenbul (Andropadus latirostris, Pycnonotidae) and the olive sunbird (Cyanomitra olivacea, Nectariniidae). Twenty-six mitochondrial cytochrome b lineages were identified: 20 Plasmodium lineages and 6 Haemoproteus lineages. These lineages showed no geographic specificity, nor significant differences in lineage diversity between habitat types. However, we found that the prevalence of Leucocytozoon and Haemoproteus infections were significantly higher in undisturbed than in deforested habitats (Leucocytozoon spp. 50.3% vs. 35.8%, Haemoproteus spp. 16.3% vs. 10.8%). We also found higher prevalence for all haemosporidian parasites in C. olivacea than in A. latirostris species (70.2% vs. 58.2%). Interestingly, we found one morphospecies of Plasmodium in C. olivacea, as represented by a clade of related lineages, showed increased prevalence at disturbed sites, while another showed a decrease, testifying to different patterns of transmission, even among closely related lineages of avian malaria, in relation to deforestation. Our work demonstrates that anthropogenic habitat change can affect host-parasite systems and result in opposing trends in prevalence of haemosporidian parasites in wild bird populations.

Association Between Habitat Size, Brushtail Possum Density, and the Mosquito Fauna of Native Forests in the Auckland Region, New Zealand	ECOHEALTH			English	Article						habitat fragmentation; invasion; mosquito; forest; phytotelmata; brushtail possum	AEDES-NOTOSCRIPTUS DIPTERA; CULICIDAE; FRAGMENTATION; BIODIVERSITY; CONSEQUENCES; QUEENSLAND; INVASIONS; DISPERSAL; VECTORS	Human activities have been causing dramatic and unprecedented changes to the Earth's ecosystems, and are a primary factor associated with biological invasions. Disturbed and fragmented habitats allow some vector mosquitoes to thrive. The New Zealand landscape has been extensively modified since the arrival of humans, and there is accumulating evidence that the distribution of mosquitoes is being altered as a result of anthropogenic environmental changes. This study aimed to assess whether forest habitat size affected the community composition of mosquitoes, and whether the density of the introduced brushtail possum would benefit exotic mosquito species that feed primarily on mammal hosts. Extensive sampling of the mosquito community was carried out using dry ice-baited light traps, oviposition traps, and larval surveys. The results provided the first experimental evidence in New Zealand that changes in forest habitat size affect the indigenous and introduced mosquito fauna differently. The proportion of native species making up the mosquito community appears to be steadily reduced as native forest habitats become smaller. In contrast, the opposite pattern appears to occur for the introduced vector Aedes notoscriptus. Although there was a trend indicating that possums may have a negative impact on a native species (Culex pervigilans), the impact of these animals on the mosquito fauna remains unclear. The evidence suggests that the conservation of large pristine forest ecosystems in New Zealand could have human health implications.	[Derraik, Jose G.

The recommended Course of treatment for Ae. albopictus is to keep yards free of water-holding containers; however, infestations may require additional control methods such as residual pesticide applications to vegetation. Five plants commonly found in yards or in uncultivated areas in Gainesville, FL were chosen as substrates for evaluation of the effectiveness of residual bifenthrin against 5-7-day-old female Ae. albopictus. Knockdown of mosquitoes after I h of exposure was highest the day of and 7 days after treatment. Plant species clearly impacted the effectiveness of residual bifenthrin. One-hour knockdown 7 days after treatment remained high (>62%) only on azalea and holly bush vegetation. Knockdown counts 24 h after exposure demonstrated that residual efficacy of bifenthrin was highest on azalea, with >77% mortality for up to 35 days. Additional bioassays revealed significant differences in the knockdown rates of male, female, gravid, and blood-fed Ae. albopictus exposed to residual bifenthrin treatments, with the highest knockdown observed on the day of and 7 days after treatment.

An. gambiae mosquitoes were fed with P falciparum-infected blood through membrane feeders. Fed mosquitoes were placed in houses in forested and deforested areas in a highland area (1,500 m above sea level) and monitored for parasite development. Deforested sites had higher temperatures and relative humidities, and the overall infection rate of mosquitoes was increased compared with that in forested sites. Sporozoites appeared on average 1.1 days earlier in deforested areas. Vectorial capacity was estimated to be 77.7% higher in the deforested site than in the forested site. We showed that deforestation changes microclimates, leading to more rapid sporogonic development of P. falciparum and to a marked increase of malaria risk in the western Kenyan highland.

Landscape, demographic, entomological, and climatic associations with human disease incidence of West Nile virus in the state of Iowa, USA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH GEOGRAPHICS			English	Article							MOSQUITOS DIPTERA; CULICIDAE; TRANSMISSION; AMPLIFICATION; CALIFORNIA; EPIDEMIC; DYNAMICS; RIVER	Background: West Nile virus ( WNV) emerged as a threat to public and veterinary health in the Midwest United States in 2001 and continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality annually. To investigate biotic and abiotic factors associated with disease incidence, cases of reported human disease caused by West Nile virus ( WNV) in the state of Iowa were aggregated by census block groups in Iowa for the years 2002 - 2006. Spatially explicit data on landscape, demographic, and climatic conditions were collated and analyzed by census block groups. Statistical tests of differences between means and distributions of landscape, demographic, and climatic variables for census block groups with and without WNV disease incidence were carried out. Entomological data from Iowa were considered at the state level to add context to the potential ecological events taking place. Results: Numerous statistically significant differences were shown in the means and distributions of various landscape and demographic variables for census block groups with and without WNV disease incidence. Census block groups with WNV disease incidence had significantly lower population densities than those without. Landscape variables showing differences included stream density, road density, land cover compositions, presence of irrigation, and presence of animal feeding operations. Statistically significant differences in the annual means of precipitations, dew point, and minimum temperature for both the year of WNV disease incidence and the prior year, were detected in at least one year of the analysis for each parameter. However, the differences were not consistent between years. Conclusion: The analysis of human WNV disease incidence by census block groups in Iowa demonstrated unique landscape, demographic, and climatic associations. Our results indicate that multiple ecological WNV transmission dynamics are most likely taking place in Iowa. In 2003 and 2006, drier conditions were associated with WNV disease incidence. In a significant novel finding, rural agricultural settings were shown to be strongly associated with human WNV disease incidence in Iowa.

We used remotely sensed vegetation indices to discriminate among mosquito habitats within a densely populated urban environment in New Haven, CT. ASTER derived vegetation indices were identified for 16 sites where adult mosquitoes were trapped over the summer of 2004. Canonical correlation analysis showed a significant relationship between the environmental variables (normalized difference vegetation index, disease/water stress index and distance to water) and four local West Nile virus competent vectors (Cx. pipiens, Cx. restuans, Cx. salinarius, and Ae. vexans) (0.93, P = 0.03) explaining 86% of the variance in the environmental and mosquito measures. Sites were clustered based on these remotely sensed environmental variables. Three clusters were identified which provide insight into the distribution of West Nile virus vectors in an urban area. Identification of habitat differences of mosquitoes within the urban landscape has important implications for understanding West Nile virus transmission and for control of vector-competent mosquito species.

Evaluation of pyrethrin and permethrin ground ultra-low volume applications for adult Culex control in rural and urban environments of the Coachella Valley of California	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MOSQUITO CONTROL ASSOCIATION			English	Article						adult mosquito control; ULV ground applications; Pyrenone 25-5; Aqua-Reslin; Culex tarsalis	WESTERN EQUINE ENCEPHALOMYELITIS; LOUIS ENCEPHALITIS VIRUSES; TARSALIS DIPTERA; NILE-VIRUS; EXPERIMENTAL-INFECTION; KERN COUNTY; CULICIDAE; POPULATIONS; INSECTICIDE; AEROSOLS	Six experimental ground ultra-low volume (ULV) applications of Pyrenoneg((R)) 25-5 (0.0025 lb/acre) and Aqua-Resling((R)) (0.007 lb/acre) were made by truck-mounted Pro-Mist((R)) or London Fog((R)) equipment over 1-mi(2) study areas in rural and residential environments of the Coachella Valley, Riverside County, California. Efficacy of replicate applications was evaluated by measuring mortality among caged sentinel mosquitoes, by evaluating changes in host-seeking abundance at replicated dry ice-baited traps positioned along intersecting east-west and north-south transects, and by differential recapture patterns of marked females released near traps in the sprayed central core and unsprayed control areas. Sentinel mortality agreed well with estimates of droplet density measured by slide spinners and was affected by 1) distance of cages from the truck route; 2) landscape features, such as tree lines that created wind shadows; 3) irregular landscape that disrupted the particle cloud; 4) low wind speed that failed to carry the droplet cloud through the environment; and 5) failure of the droplets to penetrate dead airspace within stands of vegetation. Despite variable sentinel mortality, Culex tarsalis relative abundance in rural landscapes within and around our study areas always declined after ULV applications. Concurrent decreases in abundance at traps within sprayed and adjoining unsprayed areas confounded our estimates of percentage of control using Mulla's formula, which compares abundance in sprayed and unsprayed areas pre- and postspray. ULV applications significantly affected recapture patterns, in that recapture rates within the spray zone usually were significantly less than in the unsprayed zone. Collectively, our data indicated that ground ULV applications measurably reduced Cx. tarsalis abundance in rural areas of the Coachella Valley but that further evaluations may be necessary to validate efficacy on Culex quinquefasciatus populations in residential communities.

To determine if temperature, precipitation, or degree of urbanization were similarly important in the number of potential mosquito vectors for West Nile virus in the moderately temperate climate of western Washington, mosquitoes were collected using CDC carbondioxide/light traps set throughout the Seattle region during the summers of 2003 and 2004. The type and abundance of recovered species were compared to ecological correlates. Temperature and mosquito abundance were positively correlated, while precipitation was not strongly correlated with numbers of mosquitoes. Potential WNV mosquito vectors were most abundant in urban and suburban sites, including sites near communal roosts of American crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos). Exurban sites had the greatest vector species diversity, and Culex pipiens was the most abundant species throughout the region.

Po'ouli landscape bioinformatics models predict energetics, behavior, diets, and distribution on Maui	INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Annual Meeting of the Society-for-Integrative-and-Comparative-Biology	JAN 04-08, 2006	Orlando, FL				MECHANISTIC ECOLOGY; SOLAR-RADIATION; MAMMALS; BIOENERGETICS; CONSERVATION; PHYSIOLOGY; AMAKIHI; CLIMATE	This study uses a spatially explicit microclimate/biophysical approach to examine the potential distribution of the Po'ouli on Maui to find either new habitats to search for existence or refine search efforts in previously occupied areas. We used specific physiological and behavioral ecology bird data, and Po'ouli morphological and spectral data obtained from museum specimens to address ecological and conservation-related questions about the Po'ouli that are other-wise very difficult to quantify. Laboratory and field tested microclimate and biophysical-behavioral animal computer models were integrated with remote sensing technologies. To show that the generic microclimate and enclotherm models can predict metabolic and water loss requirements of Hawaiian Honeycreepers, we used the 2 species with known physiological properties, the Hawaiian Amakihi, Hemignathus virens, and the Hawaiian Anianiau, Hemignathus parvus. Predictions were within experimental measurement error of the laboratory measurements. Then using field rather than laboratory conditions as input data, we predict the field distribution of the Amakihi on Maui as the first spatial test of the models applied to birds. Results are consistent with Amakihi field distribution data. Fossils show that the Po'ouli once lived on Maui at low elevations in dry/mesic habitats on a likely diet of native tree snails and insects. The arrival of lethal mosquito-borne avian malaria in Hawaii exterminated low elevation Po'ouli forcing a population shift to mountain rainforests and possibly a snail diet instead of insects. To explore the maximum consequences of such a diet shift we assumed exclusive diets of snails versus insects at both low and high elevations. Snail diets require similar to 4 times higher foraging rates than do insect diets, making a predominantly snail diet an unlikely prospect for the Po'ouli. Landscape scale simulations suggest that a snail diet would force a Po'ouli distribution inconsistent with observations. A predominantly insect diet is consistent with distribution observations. We show that as local environmental conditions change across the landscape in space and diurnal/seasonal time it is possible to quantify animal physiological and behavioral consequences of those variations in their local environment. This enables quantification of the requisite spatial and temporal distribution and amount or availability of resources that may affect species' potential for survival, growth, reproduction and distribution.

Two species [great egret (Ardea alba) and snowy egret (Egretta thula)] nest in mixed-species colonies on islands in Narragansett Bay and regularly forage in adjacent salt marshes. We surveyed 13 salt marshes approximately twice weekly during the breeding and post-breeding seasons in 2001 and 2002. Based on resource selection functions, foraging great and snowy egrets strongly preferred pools within salt marshes, while mosquito control ditches were rarely used. Foraging egrets were never detected in stands of common reed (Phragmites australis). The number of egrets using individual marshes varied considerably, although density estimates were far less variable. Salt marsh area was better at predicting the mean number of foraging egrets using a marsh than landscape-level parameters, such as distance to the nearest nesting colony or the total area of salt marsh within 5 km. Carefully designed salt marsh restoration projects could benefit local egret populations because it appears that foraging habitat availability may be a limiting factor. To ensure use by foraging egrets, salt marsh restoration designs should increase the availability of pool and open water habitat, reduce common reed, and modify deep ditches and channels to make them more accessible for foraging egrets.

Thus, heterogeneity in human biting reflects underlying spatial heterogeneity in the distribution and suitability of larval habitat as well as inherent differences in the attractiveness, suitability and distribution of blood-meal hosts. One of the possible strategies of malaria control is to identify local vector species and then attack water bodies that contain their larvae. Methods: Biting and host seeking, not oviposition, have been the focus of most previous studies of mosquitoes and malaria transmission. This study presents a mathematical model that incorporates mosquito oviposition behaviour. Results: The model demonstrates that oviposition is one potential factor explaining heterogeneous biting and vector distribution in a landscape with a heterogeneous distribution of larval habitat. Adult female mosquitoes tend to aggregate around places where they oviposit, thereby increasing the risk of malaria, regardless of the suitability of the habitat for larval development. Thus, a water body may be unsuitable for adult mosquito emergence, but simultaneously, be a source for human malaria. Conclusion: Larval density may be a misleading indicator of a habitat's importance for malaria control. Even if mosquitoes could be lured to oviposit in sprayed larval habitats, this would not necessarily mitigate - and might aggravate - the risk of malaria transmission. Forcing mosquitoes to fly away from humans in search of larval habitat may be a more efficient way to reduce the risk of malaria than killing larvae. Thus, draining, fouling, or filling standing water where mosquitoes oviposit can be more effective than applying larvicide.

We experimentally examined the relative impact of native and introduced predatory fish on a temporary wetland amphibian assemblage to determine whether these predators exert distinct (unique or non-substitutable) or equivalent (similar) impacts on prey. Predatory fish included the eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki), golden topminnow (Fundulus chrysotus), flagfish (Jordanella floridae), and the introduced walking catfish (Clarias batrachus). The tadpole assemblage included four common species known to co-occur in temporary wetlands in south-central Florida, USA: the oak toad (Bufo quercicus), pinewoods treefrog (Hyla femoralis), squirrel treefrog (Hyla squirella), and eastern narrowmouth toad (Gastrophryne carolinensis). Tadpoles were exposed to different predators in wading pools under conditions similar to those found in surrounding temporary wetlands (particularly in terms of substrate type, the degree of habitat complexity, and temperature). Native predators were similar with respect to predation rate and prey selectivity, suggesting similar energy requirements and foraging behavior. Conversely, native fish predators, especially G. holbrooki, were distinct from the introduced C. batrachus. In contrast to expectations, C. batrachus were less voracious predators than native fish, particularly G. holbrooki. Moreover, survival of G. carolinensis and H. femoralis were higher in the presence of C. batrachus than G. holbrooki. We suggest that C. batrachus was a less efficient predator than native fish because the foraging behavior of this species resulted in low predator-prey encounter rates, and thus predation rate.

Using CO2 traps placed inside and outside of colonies, we found that total mosquito abundance increased significantly with the number of active cliff swallow nests at a colony site. We found no effect of date or weather conditions on the number of mosquitoes caught at the different sites. By classifying the landscape from aerial photographs within a 2-km-diameter circle centered on each colony site, we found no significant relationships between habitat type near a colony site and cliff swallow colony size or mosquito abundance. Proximity to livestock could not account for our results. Culex tarsalis was proportionately more likely to be caught inside a colony than at traps 30 m away, but the proportion of C. tarsalis inside a colony did not vary with colony size. Our results cannot be explained by date- or weather-related sampling artifacts or by differences in habitat between sites. Most likely, mosquitoes, especially A. vexans, are attracted to the vicinity of large cliff swallow colonies.

J	Barnes, DKA				Barnes, DKA			Hermit crabs, humans and Mozambique mangroves	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						hermit crabs; mangrove forest; niche; resource	QUIRIMBA ISLAND; GASTROPOD SHELLS; ECOLOGY; RESOURCE; PREDATION; COMPETITION; COEXISTENCE	There is a complex interrelationship between upper shore hermit crabs (such as Coenobita sp. and Clibanarius sp.), coastal human populations and mangrove forests in Mozambique. The abundance, activity, shell selection and behaviour of three species of hermit crab are related to the level of mangrove cover. With increased density of mangrove trees, the study species of hermit crab changed in abundance, tended to become diurnal, spent more time feeding and were clustered in larger groups when doing so, and selected longer spired shells. All five of the same variables are also linked to the proximity and activity of humans through both direct and indirect actions. Direct effects included a tendency to nocturnal activity with proximity to human activity; indirect effects included increased and more clumped food supplies, and shell middens from intertidal harvesting and deforestation. Mangroves are important to local human populations as well as to hermit crabs, for a wide variety of (similar) reasons. Mangroves provide storm shelter, fisheries and fishery nursery grounds for adjacent human settlements, but they also harbour mosquito populations and their removal provides valuable building materials and fuel. Hermit crabs may be useful (indirectly) to coastal human populations by being a source of food to certain commercial species, and by quickly consuming rotting/discarded food and faeces (thereby reducing disease and pests). They can also cause minor problems to coastal human populations because they use shells of (fisheries) target mollusc species and can be more abundant than the living molluscs, thereby slowing down effective hand collection through confusion over identification. The mixture of positive and negative attributes that the three groups impart to each other in the Quirimba Archipelago. northern Mozambique, is discussed.

Vegetation and other landscape features used by roosting or nesting birds at night dictate their exposure to nocturnally active host-seeking Culex tarsalis Coquillett and therefore to western equine encephalomyelitis and St. Louis encephalitis viruses. Precipitin tests on 645 Cx. tarsalis that were collected resting and host-seeking near the Salton Sea in Coachella Valley, CA, indicated that passeriform birds (64%) and rabbits (25%) were the most frequent bloodmeal hosts and that the percentage of females feeding on birds varied temporally as an inverse function of mosquito abundance. Blood meals were not taken from communally roosting water birds. The spatial distribution of host-seeking females then was investigated by deploying dry ice baited traps within seven sites representative of habitats found along the Salton Sea. Mosquito catch was greatest at traps within elevated vegetation such as Tamarisk, mesquite, cattails, and orchards and lowest at traps positioned at snags over water, sand bars, open fields, and within housing in a small rural community. These data indicate that host-seeking Cx. tarsalis females congregated at specific landscape features that were not necessarily associated with large concentrations of potential bloodmeal hosts.

Each environmental change, whether occurring as a natural phenomenon or through human intervention, changes the ecological balance and context within which disease hosts or vectors and parasites breed, develop, and transmit disease. Each species occupies a particular ecological niche and vector species sub-populations are distinct behaviourally and genetically as they adapt to man-made environments. Most zoonotic parasites display three distinct life cycles: sylvatic, zoonotic, and anthroponotic. In adapting to changed environmental conditions, including reduced non human population and increased human population, some vectors display conversion from a primarily zoophyllic to primarily anthrophyllic orientation. Deforestation and ensuing changes in landuse, human settlement, commercial development, road construction, water control systems (dams, canals, irrigation systems, reservoirs), and climate, singly, and in combination have been accompanied by global increases in morbidity and mortality from emergent parasitic disease. The replacement of forests with crop farming, ranching, and raising small animals can create supportive habitats for parasites and their host vectors. When the landuse of deforested areas changes, the pattern of human settlement is altered and habitat fragmentation may provide opportunities for exchange and transmission of parasites to the heretofore uninfected humans. Construction of water control projects can lead to shifts in such vector populations as snails and mosquitoes and their parasites. Construction of roads in previously inaccessible forested areas can lead to erosion, and stagnant ponds by blocking the Row of streams when the water rises during the rainy season. The combined effects of environmentally detrimental changes in local landuse and alterations in global climate disrupt the natural ecosystem and can increase the risk of transmission of parasitic diseases to the human population.

Overall, 74 WEE and one SLE isolates were obtained from 222,455 Cx. tarsalis females tested in 4,988 pools. In addition, 133 and 40 seroconversions were detected in 28 chicken flocks, and 143 and 27 of 20,192 sera tested from 149 species of wild birds were positive for antibodies to WEE and SLE, respectively. WEE was active in all three valleys, whereas SLE only was detected in Coachella Valley. Seroconversions in sentinel chickens provided the most sensitive indication of enzootic activity and were correlated with seroprevalence rates in wild birds. Avian seroprevalence rates did not provide an early warning of pending enzootic activity. in chickens, because positive sera from after hatching year birds collected during spring most probably were the result of infections acquired during the previous season. Few seroconversions were detected among banded recaptured birds collected during spring and early summer. Age and resident status, but not sex, were significant risk factors for wild bird infection, with the highest seroprevalence rates among after hatching year individuals of permanent resident species. Migrants (with the exception of mourning doves) and winter resident species rarely were positive. House finches, house sparrows, Gambel's quail, California quail, common ground doves, and mourning doves were most frequently positive for antibodies. The initial detection of enzootic activity each summer coincided closely with the appearance of hatching year birds of these species in our study areas, perhaps indicating their role in virus amplification. Bird species most frequently positive roosted or nested in elevated upland vegetation, sites where Cx. tarsalis host-seeking females hunt most frequently. These serosurveys provided important background information for planned host competence and chronic infection studies.

WEE was detected during 1995 by the seroconversion of sentinel chickens concurrently at sites within and outside of the area supporting Ae. dorsalis. WEE was not detected during 1994 or 1996; neither was WEE detected by seroconversion of sentinel rabbits nor by isolation from host-seeking females of either the primary vector, Culex tarsalis Coquillett (42,083 females tested in 913 pools), or Ae. dorsalis (10,804 females tested in 245 pools and 1,940 adults reared from field-collected immatures tested in 72 pools). Collectively, the results of this and previous investigations indicate that Ae. dorsalis may not be essential for the maintenance or amplification of WEE virus in southeastern California.

ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY			English	Article						mosquito control; red-winged blackbird; wetlands	ORGANISMS	We found no convincing evidence that reproduction, growth, or foraging behavior of red-winced blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) were negatively impacted by treatments of wetlands with either Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti, applied as Vectobac-G granules) or methoprene (applied as Altosid sand granules). Most red-winged blackbird parameters examined varied annually and some differences were found before treatments began. In all cases, differences found before treatments were either found again during the treatment years or no patterns existed to suggest impacts of mosquito control treatments. Only 1 of the 22 variables examined indicated a significant difference between a treatment group and the controls; males in Bti-treated sites were larger than males in control sires during the treatment years. Clutch size indicated a significant treatment-by-year interaction and was higher in control areas as compared with Bti-treated areas in 3 of the 6 years of study; 2 years occurred before any treatments were applied. Data from benthic aquatic insect studies showed that aquatic insects were depressed in wetlands treated with both methoprene and Bti In July and August. However, it is unlikely that food available to avian species in these wetlands was lower during the breeding season (May and June). Other portions of the avian life cycle that may be affected include the dispersal of young birds within or to these sites and individuals that use wetlands during migration. Impacts on these aspects of the avian community and landscape-level effects of treatments were not addressed.

Of 85,197 anophelines collected in 1,276 paired indoor and outdoor landing catches, 40.4% were Anopheles koliensis Owen, 36.7% An. punctulatus Donitz, 14.3% An. karwari (James), 4.9% An. farauti s.l. Laveran, 3.1% An, longirostris Brug, and 0.7% An. bancroftii Giles. Maps of average indoor biting rates were produced using a Bayesian conditional autoregressive model which allowed for heterogeneities in sampling effort over time and space. Differences in spatial distributions among species were observed among and within villages and were related to the distribution of larval habitats and vegetation. Abundance of An. punctulatus and An. koliensis decreased with distance from the main waterway and probably from a sage swamp forest at 6 villages in North Wosera. Abundance of An. punctulatus was associated negatively with those of An. farauti s.l., An. longirostris, and An. bancroftii. The latter 3 species also had relatively low ratios of indoor-to-outdoor biting rates, and earlier biting times than An. punctulatus. Human blood indices of at least 0.79 were observed for all species except An. bancroftii. Abundance of all 6 species was correlated temporally with recent rainfall, but An. koliensis, An. karwari, and An. longirostris showed greater temporal variability than the other species. An. punctulatus and An. koliensis tended to occur together in time and space (index of association, I=0.85). Weaker associations were seen between An. farauti s.l, and An. longirostris (I=0.44) and An. koliensis and An. karwari (I=0.34). The most frequently collected species occurred together and were concentrated near the Amugu river; the remaining species tended to occur together but in different parts of the Wosera area. The importance of understanding ecological requirements of the different Anopheles vectors and their association with key household and landscape features are dis cussed in relation to malaria transmission and control.

An. albimanus adults were collected weekly in each village using UV-light traps between July 1991 and August 1992. Based on rainfall, the study was divided into 6 seasonal periods. Villages were considered to have high mosquito abundance when >5 mosquitoes per trap per night were collected during any 1 of the 6 seasonal periods. The extension and frequency of 11 land cover types surrounding villages were determined using aerial photographs and subsequently verified through field surveys. Elevation was the main landscape feature that separated villages with low and high mosquito abundance. All villages with high mosquito abundance were below 25 m. Transitional and mangrove land cover were found only in the high mosquito abundance group. Flooded areas as potential breeding sites and potential adult resting sites in unmanaged pastures were significantly more frequent in areas surrounding villages with high mosquito abundance. No significant differences in density of cattle and horses were found among village groups. Overall, surrounding breeding sites located at low elevations in flooded unmanaged pastures seemed to be the most important determinants of An. albimanus adult abundance in the villages.

Both viruses repeatedly were detected first at a salt marsh adjacent to the Salton Sea in the southeastern corner df the study area and then disseminated to the northwest to freshwater marsh, agricultural, and residential habitats. Virus dissemination was relatively slow (<1 km/d) and may have been accomplished by dispersive host-seeking mosquitoes. Repeated early-season recovery of virus activity indicated that both viruses may persist interseasonally in salt marsh habitat.

Selected examples are considered from viral and parasitic infections (arboviruses, malaria, filariases, Chagas Disease and schistosomiasis) where disease patterns have been directly or indirectly influenced by loss of natural tropical forests. A wide range of activities have resulted in deforestation. These include colonisation and settlement, transmigrant programmes, logging, agricultural activities to provide for cash crops, mining, hydropower development and fuelwood collection. Each activity influences the prevalence, incidence and distribution of vector-borne disease. Three main regions are considered - South America, West & Central Africa and South-East Asia. In each, documented changes in vector ecology and behaviour and disease pattern have occurred. Such changes result from human activity at the forest interface and within the forest. They include both deforestation and reafforestation programmes. Deforestation, or activities associated with it, have produced new habitats for Anopheles darlingi mosquitoes and have caused malaria epidemics in South America. The different species complexes in South-East Asia (A. dirus, A. minimus, A. balabacensis) have been affected in different ways by forest clearance with different impacts on malaria incidence. The ability of zoophilic vectors to adapt to human blood as an alternative source of food and to become associated with human dwellings (peridomestic behaviour) have influenced the distribution of the leishmaniases in South America. Certain species of sandflies (Lutzomyia intermedia, Lu. longipalpis, Lu. whitmani), which were originally zoophilic and sylvatic, have adapted to feeding on humans in peridomestic and even periurban situations. The changes in behaviour of reservoir hosts and the ability of pathogens to adapt to new reservoir hosts in the newly-created habitats also influence the patterns of disease. In anthroponotic infections, such as Plasmodium, Onchocerca and Wuchereria, changes in disease patterns and vector ecology may be more difficult to detect. Detailed knowledge of vector species and species complexes is needed in relation to changing climate associated with deforestation. The distributions of the Anopheles gambiae and Simulium damnosum species complexes in West Africa are examples. There have been detailed longitudinal studies of Anopheles gambiae populations in different ecological zones of West Africa. Studies on Simulium damnosum cytoforms (using chromosome identification methods) in the Onchocerciasis Control Programme were necessary to detect changes in distribution of species in relation to changed habitats. These examples underline the need for studies on the taxonomy of medically-important insects in parallel with long-term observations on changing habitats. In some circumstances destruction of the forest has reduced or even removed disease transmission (e.g. S. neavei-transmitted Onchocerca in Kenya). Whilst the process of deforestation can be expected to continue, hopefully at a decreased rate, it is expected that unpredictable and sometimes rapid changes in disease patterns will pose problems for the public health services.

","","MALARIA J","1475-2875",NA,"Background: Heterogeneous patterns of malaria transmission are thought to be driven by factors including host genetics, distance to mosquito breeding sites, housing construction, and socio-behavioural characteristics. Evaluation of local transmission epidemiology to characterize malaria risk is essential for planning malaria control and elimination programmes. The use of geographical information systems (GIS) techniques has been a major asset to this approach. To assess time and space distribution of malaria disease in Bandiagara, Mali, within a transmission season, data were used from an ongoing malaria incidence study that enrolled 300 participants aged under six years old. Methods: Children's households were georeferenced using a handheld global position system. Clinical malaria was defined as a positive blood slide for Plasmodium falciparum asexual stages associated with at least one of the following signs: headache, body aches, fever, chills and weakness. Daily rainfall was measured at the local weather station. Landscape features of Bandiagara were obtained from satellite images and field survey. QGIS (TM) software was used to map malaria cases, affected and non-affected children, and the number of malaria episodes per child in each block of Bandiagara. Clusters of high or low risk were identified under SaTScan (R) software according to a Bernoulli model. Results: From June 2009 to May 2010, 296 clinical malaria cases were recorded. Though clearly temporally related to the rains, Plasmodium falciparum occurrence persisted late in the dry season. Two hot spots of malaria transmission also found, notably along the Yame River, characterized by higher than expected numbers of malaria cases, and high numbers of clinical episodes per child. Conversely, the north-eastern sector of the town had fewer cases despite its proximity to a large body of standing water which was mosquito habitat. Conclusion: These results confirm the existence of a marked spatial heterogeneity of malaria transmission in Bandiagara, providing support for implementation of targeted interventions.

Hosts or habitats: What drives the spatial distribution of mosquitoes?

For mosquitoes, existing spatial models use only habitat elements (hydrologic and floristic) to predict the distribution of disease vectors within the landscape, ignoring the potential importance of the distribution of hosts. We tested the hypothesis that the distribution of hosts would better explain the spatial distribution of mosquitoes than habitat variables using Information Theory and Poisson Regression. We analyzed the abundance of ectotherm-biting mosquitoes and their hosts from 37 points over a 28-km(2) area in Tuskegee National Forest, Alabama, USA. We compared models built using information regarding habitat, hosts, or both for their ability to explain the abundance of Culex peccator and Culex territans, two mosquito species that specialize on reptiles and amphibians. Models built using both host and habitat information were the best models for both species, suggesting that information regarding the distribution of mosquito hosts greatly improves models of mosquito distributions. Moreover, when differences in habitat makeup among stations were accounted for, mosquitoes were found to be significantly more abundant at locations with greater host abundance. Since most mosquitoes feed on only a limited range of hosts and successful blood feeding is one of the most crucial bottlenecks in the life cycle of mosquitoes, it follows that mosquitoes would aggregate in areas of greatest host density. Habitat influences the availability of suitable larval development sites, and to some extent, distribution of hosts. Our analysis, however, shows that within the landscape the distribution of host animals is a crucial factor in determining the spatial distribution of vectors. This has clear and important implications for determining which areas are at a greater risk for zoonotic arboviruses and is a potentially transformative paradigm for understanding the factors that influence the spatial distribution of disease vectors.

These include several instances of simple mutational adaptations, often to hosts closely related to the natural reservoirs. However, based on theoretical grounds, arthropod-borne viruses, or arboviruses, may face several challenges for adaptation to new hosts. Here, we review recent findings regarding adaptive evolution of arboviruses and its impact on disease emergence. We focus on the zoonotic alphaviruses Venezuelan equine encephalitis and chikungunya viruses, which have undergone adaptive evolution that mediated recent outbreaks of disease, as well as the flaviviruses dengue and West Nile viruses, which have emerged via less dramatic adaptive mechanisms.

West Nile Virus Prevalence across Landscapes Is Mediated by Local Effects of Agriculture on Vector and Host Communities	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CULEX-TARSALIS DIPTERA; COREGIONALIZATION ANALYSIS; MULTISCALE ASSESSMENT; SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS; LARGE-SCALE; CULICIDAE; RISK; EPIDEMIOLOGY; DIVERSITY; OUTBREAKS	Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) threaten the health of humans, livestock, and wildlife. West Nile virus (WNV), the world's most widespread arbovirus, invaded the United States in 1999 and rapidly spread across the county. Although the ecology of vectors and hosts are key determinants of WNV prevalence across landscapes, the factors shaping local vector and host populations remain unclear. Here, we used spatially-explicit models to evaluate how three land-use types (orchards, vegetable/forage crops, natural) and two climatic variables (temperature, precipitation) influence the prevalence of WNV infections and vector/host distributions at landscape and local spatial scales. Across landscapes, we show that orchard habitats were associated with greater prevalence of WNV infections in reservoirs (birds) and incidental hosts (horses), while increased precipitation was associated with fewer infections. At local scales, orchard habitats increased the prevalence of WNV infections in vectors (mosquitoes) and the abundance of mosquitoes and two key reservoir species, the American robin and the house sparrow. Thus, orchard habitats benefitted WNV vectors and reservoir hosts locally, creating focal points for the transmission of WNV at landscape scales in the presence of suitable climatic conditions.

To determine the influence of hematophagous insects on endangered vertebrates requires specially designed programs that minimize disturbance to the hosts and address problems associated with their small populations. We developed and evaluated a surveillance program for black flies potentially affecting a population of whooping cranes (Grus americana) introduced to central Wisconsin, U.S.A. In one of the few studies to survey host-seeking female black flies and their immature stages concurrently, we processed nearly 346,000 specimens and documented 26 species, of which only two, Simulium annulus and Simulium johannseni, were attracted to nesting whooping cranes. Attempts to assess black fly populations with artificial nests and real crane eggs were unsuccessful. Carbon-dioxide traps performed well in describing black fly taxa on the landscape. However, the number of black flies at whooping crane nests was consistently higher than the number captured in carbon-dioxide traps. The carbon-dioxide traps poorly described the presence/absence, population fluctuations, and periodicity of black flies at whooping crane nests. The weak performance of the carbon-dioxide traps might have resulted from microhabitat differences between trap locations and nests or from Simulium annulus and Simulium johannseni using sensory cues in addition to carbon dioxide to find hosts. Choice of trapping techniques, therefore, depends on the information required for the particular study objectives.

There are numerous important vector species, with variable geographic ranges and ecologies, considered crucial to the transmission of WNV in the coterminous United States. To date there has been a lack of a systematic investigation in the United States, at a regional scale, of the wide variety of landscape, land use, and demographic influences on WNV incidence. In this study, we use published vector species distribution maps, as well as prominent landscape features, to define six distinct regions of the coterminous United States. We relate data on demographic, landscape, and land use conditions to the incidence of human WNV by region recorded at county level in the coterminous United States from 2002-2009. The observed relationships varied by region with the Great Plains, Northwest, and Southwest regions showing high WNV incidence associated with rural irrigated landscapes, indicating the importance of Culex tarsalis as the primary vector. In the Southeast, the percent of the population in poverty was positively associated with high WNV incidence, potentially indicating the quality of housing in relation to the vector Culex quinquefasciatus, a mosquito that often feeds indoors. The Northeast region human WNV incidence was positively associated with agricultural landscapes, potentially implying the importance of Culex restuans in a region generally thought of as being dominated by Culex pipiens transmission. There was strong spatial autocorrelation in most of the regions, but with a spatial autologistic term accounted for in binary logistic regression models, there were significant landscape, land use, and demographic covariates for each region.

With increasing urbanization and the resulting emergence of zoonotic diseases, it is critical to understand the relationships among birds, vectors, zoonotic pathogens, and the urban landscape. Here, we use wild birds as sentinels across a gradient of urbanization to understand the relative risk of diseases caused by three types of zoonotic pathogens: Salmonella pathogens, mosquito-borne West Nile virus (WNV) and tick-borne pathogens, including the agents of Lyme disease and human anaplasmosis. Wild birds were captured using mist nets at five sites throughout greater Chicago, Illinois, and blood, faecal and ectoparasite samples were collected for diagnostic testing. A total of 289 birds were captured across all sites. A total of 2.8% of birds harboured Ixodes scapularis the blacklegged tick of which 54.5% were infected with the agent of Lyme disease, and none were infected with the agent of human anaplasmosis. All infested birds were from a single site that was relatively less urban. A single bird, captured at the only field site in which supplemental bird feeding was practised within the mist netting zone, was infected with Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica. While no birds harboured WNV in their blood, 3.5% of birds were seropositive, and birds from more urban sites had higher exposure to the virus than those from less urban sites. Our results demonstrate the presence of multiple bird-borne zoonotic pathogens across a gradient of urbanization and provide an assessment of potential public health risks to the high-density human populations within the area.

Losing identity: structural diversity of transposable elements belonging to different classes in the genome of Anopheles gambiae	BMC GENOMICS			English	Article						Transposable elements; LTR; Non-LTR; Class II; Deterioration; Anopheles gambiae	DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER; LTR RETROTRANSPOSONS; DNA LOSS; EVOLUTIONARY DYNAMICS; REGULATORY SEQUENCES; MALARIA MOSQUITO; TY3/GYPSY GROUP; WHITE GENE; FAMILIES; TARGET	Background: Transposable elements (TEs), both DNA transposons and retrotransposons, are genetic elements with the main characteristic of being able to mobilize and amplify their own representation within genomes, utilizing different mechanisms of transposition. An almost universal feature of TEs in eukaryotic genomes is their inability to transpose by themselves, mainly as the result of sequence degeneration (by either mutations or deletions). Most of the elements are thus either inactive or non-autonomous. Considering that the bulk of some eukaryotic genomes derive from TEs, they have been conceived as TE graveyards. It has been shown that once an element has been inactivated, it progressively accumulates mutations and deletions at neutral rates until completely losing its identity or being lost from the host genome; however, it has also been shown that these neutral sequences might serve as raw material for domestication by host genomes. Results: We have analyzed the sequence structural variations, nucleotide divergence, and pattern of insertions and deletions of several superfamilies of TEs belonging to both class I (long terminal repeats [LTRs] and non-LTRs [NLTRs]) and II in the genome of Anopheles gambiae, aiming at describing the landscape of deterioration of these elements in this particular genome. Our results describe a great diversity in patterns of deterioration, indicating lineage-specific differences including the presence of Solo-LTRs in the LTR lineage, 5'-deleted NLTRs, and several non-autonomous and MITEs in the class II families. Interestingly, we found fragments of NLTRs corresponding to the RT domain, which preserves high identity among them, suggesting a possible remaining genomic role for these domains. Conclusions: We show here that the TEs in the An. gambiae genome deteriorate in different ways according to the class to which they belong. This diversity certainly has implications not only at the host genomic level but also at the amplification dynamic and evolution of the TE families themselves.

J	Zhu, LD; Ketola, T				Zhu, Liandong; Ketola, Tarja			Microalgae production as a biofuel feedstock: risks and challenges	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY			English	Article						microalgae production; biofuel; impact; risk; challenge	CLIMATE-CHANGE; BIODIESEL PRODUCTION; WASTE-WATER; BIOMASS; BIODIVERSITY; ECOSYSTEMS; PHOSPHORUS; NITROGEN; RECHARGE; REMOVAL	From a sustainability perspective, the potential risks associated with microalgae production for biofuel extraction will be investigated in this paper, including the environmental, economic, social and cultural dimensions. Environmentally, four main concerns are mapped out: first, there are potential water safety risks, such as water resource abuse, water pollution and groundwater recharge deficiency; second, unreasonable construction will lead to land-use overexpansion, land pollution and service expectancy reduction; third, microalgae production may exert a detrimental effect on the local ecosystem, causing algal blooms and biological invasion; finally, microalgae might emit unexpected greenhouse gases [nitrogen oxides (NO x ), methane (CH4)] and ammonia (NH3). From an economic risk standpoint, microalgae production requires an overwhelming investment due to the expensive start-up and operation. Socially, contaminant discharge will threaten the health of local animals and people. Moreover, the safety effects of genetically modified algae may not be immediately apparent or known. In addition, over time, microalgae may become a medium for mosquitoes to spread disease. From a cultural point of view, it requires time for people in developing countries to adapt algal oil to their daily life as an alternative to conventional fossil fuels. Furthermore, personnel changes in the workforce may harm existing cultural structures, and landscape aesthetics may be affected by system construction. Taking the above challenges into consideration, efficient government policies, proactive company behaviours and positive public participation will play an important role in minimising or even eliminating these potential risks.

Mosquito-borne flaviviruses have been isolated and characterized in Northern Italy: West Nile virus and Usutu virus were detected in mosquitoes and in different host species and recent studies provided evidence about the circulation of insect Flavivirus strains. Methods: In order to clarify the diffusion and the distribution of the mosquito-transmitted flaviviruses in Italy, we analyzed Culex and Ochlerotatus mosquitoes collected in 2009 and 2010 in an area divided evenly between hills and plains and where the landscape is dominated by mixed agricultural patches, rice fields, deciduous tree forests, and urban environments. Each mosquito pool was tested for the presence of Flavivirus strains and we characterized positive samples by genetic sequencing. Results: Positive mosquito pools revealed low infection prevalence, but suggested a continuous circulation of both Usutu virus and insect Flavivirus. Interestingly, phylogenetic analyses based on NS5 gene partial sequences showed a closer relationship among new Usutu virus strains from Piedmont and the reference sequences from the Eastern Europe, with respect to Italian samples characterized so far. Moreover, NS5 gene phylogeny suggested that mosquito flaviviruses found in Italy could belong to different lineages. Conclusions: Our results contribute to a wider point of view on the heterogeneity of viruses infecting mosquitoes suggesting a taxonomical revision of the Mosquito-borne Flavivirus group.

Landscape-Level Spatial Patterns of West Nile Virus Risk in the Northern Great Plains	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE			English	Article							NEW-YORK-STATE; UNITED-STATES; LAND-COVER; HYDROLOGIC CONDITIONS; MOSQUITOS DIPTERA; CULEX MOSQUITOS; SOUTH-DAKOTA; CALIFORNIA; DISEASE; TRANSMISSION	Understanding the landscape-level determinants of West Nile virus (WNV) can aid in mapping high-risk areas and enhance disease control and prevention efforts. This study analyzed the spatial patterns of human WNV cases in three areas in South Dakota during 2003-2007 and investigated the influences of land cover, hydrology, soils, irrigation, and elevation by using case-control models. Land cover, hydrology, soils, and elevation all influenced WNV risk, although the main drivers were different in each study area. Risk for WNV was generally higher in areas with rural land cover than in developed areas, and higher close to wetlands or soils with a high ponding frequency. In western South Dakota, WNV risk also decreased with increasing elevation and was higher in forested areas. Our results showed that the spatial patterns of human WNV risk were associated with landscape-level features that likely reflect variability in mosquito ecology, avian host communities, and human activity.

We examine interactions of these aliens with their new environments in the context of rapid global change linked to human activity. We consider effects of such interactions on establishment and spread of the alien species and effects on indigenous biota and ecosystems. Major elements of global change that affect alien-environment interactions include landscape modifications by humans (e.g., cultivation, habitat loss and fragmentation) and increases in atmospheric CO2 and other gases resulting in climate change and other effects (e.g., changes in food quality for herbivores that affect higher trophic levels as well). Alien arthropod predators can alter landscapes for their benefit, to the detriment of indigenous species. A brief review also of blood-feeding alien arthropods makes clear that interactions with the environment critically influence invasions of zoophagous arthropods in general.

Decelerating Spread of West Nile Virus by Percolation in a Heterogeneous Urban Landscape	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							TRAVELING-WAVES; VACCINATION STRATEGIES; CULEX-QUINQUEFASCIATUS; INFECTIOUS-DISEASES; VECTOR COMPETENCE; YELLOW-FEVER; TRANSMISSION; POPULATIONS; MOSQUITOS; MODELS	Vector-borne diseases are emerging and re-emerging in urban environments throughout the world, presenting an increasing challenge to human health and a major obstacle to development. Currently, more than half of the global population is concentrated in urban environments, which are highly heterogeneous in the extent, degree, and distribution of environmental modifications. Because the prevalence of vector-borne pathogens is so closely coupled to the ecologies of vector and host species, this heterogeneity has the potential to significantly alter the dynamical systems through which pathogens propagate, and also thereby affect the epidemiological patterns of disease at multiple spatial scales. One such pattern is the speed of spread. Whereas standard models hold that pathogens spread as waves with constant or increasing speed, we hypothesized that heterogeneity in urban environments would cause decelerating travelling waves in incipient epidemics. To test this hypothesis, we analysed data on the spread of West Nile virus (WNV) in New York City (NYC), the 1999 epicentre of the North American pandemic, during annual epizootics from 2000-2008. These data show evidence of deceleration in all years studied, consistent with our hypothesis. To further explain these patterns, we developed a spatial model for vector-borne disease transmission in a heterogeneous environment. An emergent property of this model is that deceleration occurs only in the vicinity of a critical point. Geostatistical analysis suggests that NYC may be on the edge of this criticality. Together, these analyses provide the first evidence for the endogenous generation of decelerating travelling waves in an emerging infectious disease. Since the reported deceleration results from the heterogeneity of the environment through which the pathogen percolates, our findings suggest that targeting control at key sites could efficiently prevent pathogen spread to remote susceptible areas or even halt epidemics.

We compared abundance of vector species between urban and suburban neighborhoods of Henrico County, VA, in relation to the following factors: temperature, precipitation, canopy cover, building footprint, and proximity to drainage infrastructure. Mosquitoes were collected throughout the 2005, 2006, and 2007 seasons and tested for West Nile virus (WNV) in pools of 10-50. Test results of mosquito pools were compared to average site abundance from 37 sites in Henrico County, VA; abundance was then examined in relation to ecological variables. Urban infrastructure was positively correlated with the abundance of Culex pipiens L./Cx. restuans, and our findings implicate combined sewer overflow systems as large contributors to Culex vector populations. No measure of urbanization examined in our study was correlated with Aedes albopictus abundance. Our study showed that certain landscape variables identified using Geographic Information Systems are valuable for predicting primary WNV vector abundance in Virginia, and that temperature along with low precipitation are strong predictors of population growth. Our results support other regional studies that found WNV proliferates under drought conditions. Journal of Vector Ecology 36 (1): 75-85. 2011.

The numbers of females collected per trap night at traps along the ecotone of Eucalyptus stands with and without a heron colony were always greater or equal to numbers collected at traps within or under canopy. No Cx. tarsalis were collected within or under Eucaplytus canopy during the peak heron nesting season, even though these birds frequently were infected with West Nile virus and large number of engorged females could be collected at resting boxes. These data indicate a diversion of host-seeking females from traps to nesting birds reducing sampling efficiency.

With regard to health, the approach consists of systems analysis using a set of powerful tools aimed at the reduction of community vulnerability through improved public policies. The north-oriental malaria focus, one of five such foci in Venezuela, situated in the north-eastern part of the Estado Sucre state, unites several social and environmental features and functions as an epidemiological corridor, i.e. an endemic zone characterised by permanent interaction between the mosquito vector and the human host allowing a continuous persistence of the malaria lifecycle. A GIS was developed based on official cartography with thematic overlays depicting malaria distribution, socio-economic conditions, basic environmental information and specific features associated with the natural wetlands present in the area. Generally, malaria foci are continuously active but when the malaria situation was modelled in the north-oriental focus, a differential, spatio-temporal distribution pattern situation was found, i.e. a situation oscillating between very active and dormant transmission. This pattern was displayed by spatial and statistical analysis based on the model generated in this study and the results were confirmed by municipal and county malaria records. Control of malaria, keeping the incidence at a permanently low level within the regional population, should be possible if these results are taken into account when designing and implementing epidemiological surveillance policies.

Ecology and Transmission of Buruli Ulcer Disease: A Systematic Review	PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES			English	Review							REAL-TIME PCR; MYCOBACTERIUM-ULCERANS; RISK-FACTORS; ENVIRONMENTAL-SAMPLES; MACROLIDE TOXIN; SOUTHEASTERN AUSTRALIA; REDUCTIVE EVOLUTION; FEEDING-BEHAVIOR; NORTH QUEENSLAND; AQUATIC INSECTS	Buruli ulcer is a neglected emerging disease that has recently been reported in some countries as the second most frequent mycobacterial disease in humans after tuberculosis. Cases have been reported from at least 32 countries in Africa (mainly west), Australia, Southeast Asia, China, Central and South America, and the Western Pacific. Large lesions often result in scarring, contractual deformities, amputations, and disabilities, and in Africa, most cases of the disease occur in children between the ages of 4-15 years. This environmental mycobacterium, Mycobacterium ulcerans, is found in communities associated with rivers, swamps, wetlands, and human-linked changes in the aquatic environment, particularly those created as a result of environmental disturbance such as deforestation, dam construction, and agriculture. Buruli ulcer disease is often referred to as the mysterious disease because the mode of transmission remains unclear, although several hypotheses have been proposed. The above review reveals that various routes of transmission may occur, varying amongst epidemiological setting and geographic region, and that there may be some role for living agents as reservoirs and as vectors of M. ulcerans, in particular aquatic insects, adult mosquitoes or other biting arthropods. We discuss traditional and non-traditional methods for indicting the roles of living agents as biologically significant reservoirs and/or vectors of pathogens, and suggest an intellectual framework for establishing criteria for transmission. The application of these criteria to the transmission of M. ulcerans presents a significant challenge.

Planning for Rift Valley fever virus: use of geographical information systems to estimate the human health threat of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus)-related transmission	GEOSPATIAL HEALTH			English	Article						haemorrhagic fevers; viral prevention and control; bioterrorism; Rift Valley fever; deer; Culicidae; USA	WEST-NILE-VIRUS; DOMESTIC-ANIMALS; FEEDING PATTERNS; NORTHEAST OHIO; KENYA; OUTBREAK; DISEASE; EPIDEMIC; WILDLIFE; RISK	Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus is a mosquito-borne phlebovirus of the Bunyaviridae family that causes frequent outbreaks of severe animal and human disease in sub-Saharan Africa, Egypt and the Arabian Peninsula. Based on its many known competent vectors, its potential for transmission via aerosolization, and its progressive spread from East Africa to neighbouring regions, RVF is considered a high-priority, emerging health threat for humans, livestock and wildlife in all parts of the world. Introduction of West Nile virus to North America has shown the potential for exotic viral pathogens to become embedded in local ecological systems. While RVF is known to infect and amplify within domestic livestock, such as taurine cattle, sheep and goats, if RVF virus is accidentally or intentionally introduced into North America, an important unknown factor will be the role of local wildlife in the maintenance or propagation of virus transmission. We examined the potential impact of RVF transmission via white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in a typical north-eastern United States urban-suburban landscape, where livestock are rare but where these potentially susceptible, ungulate wildlife are highly abundant. Model results, based on overlap of mosquito, human and projected deer densities, indicate that a significant proportion (497/1186 km(2), i.e. 42%) of the urban and peri-urban landscape could be affected by RVF transmission during the late summer months. Deer population losses, either by intervention for herd reduction or by RVF-related mortality, would substantially reduce these likely transmission zones to 53.1 km(2), i.e. by 89%.

J	Lourenco, J; Recker, M				Lourenco, Jose; Recker, Mario			Viral and Epidemiological Determinants of the Invasion Dynamics of Novel Dengue Genotypes	PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES			English	Article							ANTIBODY-DEPENDENT ENHANCEMENT; HEMORRHAGIC-FEVER; AEDES-AEGYPTI; RISK-FACTORS; VIRUS; INFECTION; SELECTION; EMERGENCE; EVOLUTION; THAILAND	Background: Dengue has become a major concern for international public health. Frequent epidemic outbreaks are believed to be driven by a complex interplay of immunological interactions between its four co-circulating serotypes and large fluctuations in mosquito densities. Viral lineage replacement events, caused for example by different levels of cross-protection or differences in viral fitness, have also been linked to a temporary change in dengue epidemiology. A major replacement event was recently described for South-East Asia where the Asian-1 genotype of dengue serotype 2 replaced the resident Asian/American type. Although this was proposed to be due to increased viral fitness in terms of enhanced human-to-mosquito transmission, no major change in dengue epidemiology could be observed. Methods/Results: Here we investigate the invasion dynamics of a novel, advantageous dengue genotype within a model system and determine the factors influencing the success and rate of fixation as well as their epidemiological consequences. We find that while viral fitness overall correlates with invasion success and competitive exclusion of the resident genotype, the epidemiological landscape plays a more significant role for successful emergence. Novel genotypes can thus face high risks of stochastic extinction despite their fitness advantage if they get introduced during episodes of high dengue prevalence, especially with respect to that particular serotype. Conclusion: The rarity of markers for positive selection has often been explained by strong purifying selection whereby the constraints imposed by dengue's two-host cycle are expected to result in a high rate of deleterious mutations. Our results demonstrate that even highly beneficial mutants are under severe threat of extinction, which would suggest that apart from purifying selection, stochastic effects and genetic drift beyond seasonal bottlenecks are equally important in shaping dengue's viral ecology and evolution.

Vectors and malaria transmission in deforested, rural communities in north-central Vietnam	MALARIA JOURNAL			English	Article							ANOPHELES-DIRUS COMPLEX; MOLECULAR-IDENTIFICATION; PLASMODIUM-VIVAX; SEASONAL ABUNDANCE; MOSQUITOS DIPTERA; HOST PREFERENCE; BITING ACTIVITY; FOREST MALARIA; LAO PDR; CULICIDAE	Background: Malaria is still prevalent in rural communities of central Vietnam even though, due to deforestation, the primary vector Anopheles dirus is uncommon. In these situations little is known about the secondary vectors which are responsible for maintaining transmission. Basic information on the identification of the species in these rural communities is required so that transmission parameters, such as ecology, behaviour and vectorial status can be assigned to the appropriate species. Methods: In two rural villages - Khe Ngang and Hang Chuon - in Truong Xuan Commune, Quang Binh Province, north central Vietnam, a series of longitudinal entomological surveys were conducted during the wet and dry seasons from 2003 - 2007. In these surveys anopheline mosquitoes were collected in human landing catches, paired human and animal bait collections, and from larval surveys. Specimens belonging to species complexes were identified by PCR and sequence analysis, incrimination of vectors was by detection of circumsporozoite protein using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: Over 80% of the anopheline fauna was made up of Anopheles sinensis, Anopheles aconitus, Anopheles harrisoni, Anopheles maculatus, Anopheles sawadwongporni, and Anopheles philippinensis. PCR and sequence analysis resolved identification issues in the Funestus Group, Maculatus Group, Hyrcanus Group and Dirus Complex. Most species were zoophilic and while all species could be collected biting humans significantly higher densities were attracted to cattle and buffalo. Anopheles dirus was the most anthropophilic species but was uncommon making up only 1.24% of all anophelines collected. Anopheles sinensis, An. aconitus, An. harrisoni, An. maculatus, An. sawadwongporni, Anopheles peditaeniatus and An. philippinensis were all found positive for circumsporozoite protein. Heterogeneity in oviposition site preference between species enabled vector densities to be high in both the wet and dry seasons allowing for year round transmission. Conclusions: In rural communities in north central Vietnam, malaria transmission was maintained by a number of anopheline species which though collected feeding on humans were predominantly zoophilic, this behaviour allows for low level but persistent malaria transmission. The important animal baits - cattle and buffalo - were kept in the village and barrier spraying around these animals may be more effective at reducing vector densities and longevity than the currently used indoor residual spraying.

The Selection Landscape of Malaria Parasites	SCIENCE			English	Review							PLASMODIUM-FALCIPARUM MALARIA; RETROSPECTIVE EXAMINATION; REPRODUCTIVE RESTRAINT; ANTIGENIC DIVERSITY; PATHOGEN VIRULENCE; CLINICAL IMMUNITY; HOST ERYTHROCYTE; DRUG-RESISTANCE; GENOME; GENE	Malaria parasites have to survive and transmit within a highly selective and ever-changing host environment. Because immunity to malaria is nonsterilizing and builds up slowly through repeated infections, commonly the parasite invades a host that is immunologically and physiologically different from its previous host. During the course of infection, the parasite must also keep pace with changes in host immune responses and red-blood-cell physiology. Here, we describe the selection landscape of the most virulent of the human malaria parasites, Plasmodium falciparum, and the adaptive mechanisms it uses to navigate through that landscape. Taking a cost-benefit view of parasite fitness, we consider the evolutionary outcomes of the most important forces of selection operating on the parasite, namely immunity, host death, drugs, mosquito availability, and coinfection. Given the huge potential for malaria parasite evolution in the context of the recently renewed effort to eradicate malaria, a deeper understanding of P. falciparum adaptation is essential.

ECOLOGICAL CORRELATES OF MICROFILARIAE PREVALENCE IN ENDANGERED GALAPAGOS BIRDS	JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY			English	Article							PENGUINS SPHENISCUS-MENDICULUS; GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; WEST-NILE-VIRUS; FLIGHTLESS CORMORANT; PHALACROCORAX-HARRISI; PLASMA CHEMISTRY; SEXUAL SELECTION; BLOOD PARASITES; EL-NINO; ISLANDS	This study assesses the ecological factors associated with microfilariae prevalence in wild populations of endangered flightless cormorants (Phalacrocorax harrisi) and Galapagos penguins (Spheniscus mendiculus). Prevalence values were tested for correlation with a large number of environmental variables, as modeled from weather station data and measured by satellite-borne sensors. Predictions were made based on the expected effects of climatic and landscape variables on sustained populations of arthropod vectors required for transmission of microfilariae. In general, findings were consistent with predictions in both cormorants and penguins; prevalence correlated positively with temperature, precipitation, and vegetation density, and negatively with measures of environmental variability. Resulting correlates were used to derive predictive distributions of prevalence values in cormorants throughout the archipelago. Evidence is presented implicating the mosquito Aedes taeniorhynchus as a likely vector. Knowledge of environmental variables that predict risk of disease transmission by arthropod vectors may be useful in control measures should novel pathogens be introduced to the ecosystem.

Influence of the spatial distribution of human hosts and large size containers on the dispersal of the mosquito Aedes aegypti within the first gonotrophic cycle	MEDICAL AND VETERINARY ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						dengue; dispersal; host density; landscape; larval habitat container; spatial analysis	RIO-DE-JANEIRO; DIPTERA; CULICIDAE; POPULATIONS; MOVEMENT	It is generally accepted that Aedes aegypti (L.) (Diptera: Culicidae) has a short dispersal capacity, and that displacement can be influenced by the availability of oviposition sites in the surroundings of emergence or release sites. In the present article, we observed the influence of spatial heterogeneity of large containers and human hosts on the cumulative flight direction of Ae. aegypti females during the first gonotrophic cycle, testing the hypothesis that they aggregate in resource-rich areas, i.e. where there are higher concentrations of large containers and/or humans per habitation. We analysed data from pupal surveys and mark-release-recapture experiments (non-blood-fed females were released) carried out in two dengue endemic neighbourhoods of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil: Tubiacanga (a suburb, with a human density of 337 inhabitants/ha) and Favela do Amorim (a slum, with a human density of 901 inhabitants/ha). In both areas, host-seeking females of three different release cohorts showed an overall non-uniform and extensive dispersal from their release point within 1-2 days post-release. At 4-5 days post-release, when many of the released females would be expected to be gravid, in Tubiacanga most mosquitoes were collected in areas with a relatively higher density of containers/premise, independently of the density of residents/house, whereas in Favela do Amorim, almost half of the captured mosquitoes were collected in relatively resource-poorer areas. Although Ae. aegypti dispersal patterns varied between sites, overall the distances travelled from the release point and the cumulative flight directions were correlated with the density of containers and hosts, more markedly in Tubiacanga than in Favela do Amorim.

Blood feeding patterns of mosquitoes: random or structured?

It is also a phenomenon that pertains to the realm of community ecology, since blood-feeding patterns of vectors can occur across a community of vertebrate hosts. Although great advances in knowledge of the genetic basis for blood-feeding choices have been reported for selected vector species, little is known about the role of community composition of vertebrate hosts in determining such patterns. Methods & Results: Here, we present an analysis of feeding patterns of vectors across a variety of locations, looking at foraging patterns of communities of mosquitoes, across communities of hosts primarily comprised of mammals and birds. Using null models of species co-occurrence, which do not require ancillary information about host abundance, we found that blood-feeding patterns were aggregated in studies from multiple sites, but random in studies from a single site. This combination of results supports the idea that mosquito species in a community may rely primarily on host availability in a given landscape, and that contacts with specific hosts will be influenced more by the presence/absence of hosts than by innate mosquito choices. This observation stresses the importance of blood-feeding plasticity as a key trait explaining the emergence of many zoonotic mosquito transmitted diseases. Discussion: From an epidemiological perspective our observations support the idea that phenomena promoting synchronization of vectors and hosts can promote the emergence of vector-borne zoonotic diseases, as suggested by observations on the linkages between deforestation and the emergence of several human diseases.

Landscape Epidemiology of Vector-Borne Diseases	ANNUAL REVIEW OF ENTOMOLOGY	Annual Review of Entomology		English	Review; Book Chapter						vector; host; pathogen; climate; spatial dynamics; nidus; refugia	WEST-NILE-VIRUS; LOUIS ENCEPHALITIS-VIRUS; CULEX-TARSALIS DIPTERA; GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; NORTHEASTERN UNITED-STATES; IXODES-DAMMINI ACARI; LYME-DISEASE; COACHELLA VALLEY; NEW-YORK; SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA	Landscape epidemiology describes how the temporal dynamics of host, vector, and pathogen populations interact spatially within a permissive environment to enable transmission. The spatially defined focus, or nidus, of transmission may be characterized by vegetation as well as by climate, latitude, elevation, and geology. The ecological complexity, dimensions, and temporal stability of the nidus are determined largely by pathogen natural history and vector bionomics. Host populations, transmission efficiency, and therefore pathogen amplification vary spatially, thereby creating a heterogeneous surface that may be defined by remote sensing and statistical tools. The current review describes the evolution of landscape epidemiology as a science and exemplifies selected aspects by contrasting the ecology of two different recent disease outbreaks in North America caused by West Nile virus, ail explosive, highly virulent mosquito-borne virus producing ephemeral nidi, and Borrelia burgdorferi, a slowly amplifying chronic pathogen producing semipermanent nidi.

Predicting the impact of insecticide-treated bed nets on malaria transmission: the devil is in the detail	MALARIA JOURNAL			English	Article							ANOPHELES-GAMBIAE; IMPREGNATED BEDNETS; MOSQUITOS DIPTERA; ATTRACTION; CULICIDAE; RANGE; TANZANIA; EFFICACY; BAITS; AREA	Background: Insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs), including long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs), play a primary role in global campaigns to roll back malaria in tropical Africa. Effectiveness of treated nets depends on direct impacts on individual mosquitoes including killing and excite-repellency, which vary considerably among vector species due to variations in host-seeking behaviours. While monitoring and evaluation programmes of ITNs have focuses on morbidity and all-cause mortality in humans, local entomological context receives little attention. Without knowing the dynamics of local vector species and their responses to treated nets, it is difficult to predict clinical outcomes when ITN applications are scaled up across African continent. Sound model frameworks incorporating intricate interactions between mosquitoes and treated nets are needed to develop the predictive capacity for scale-up applications of ITNs. Methods: An established agent-based model was extended to incorporate the direct outcomes, e. g. killing and avoidance, of individual mosquitoes exposing to ITNs in a hypothetical village setting with 50 houses and 90 aquatic habitats. Individual mosquitoes were tracked throughout the life cycle across the landscape. Four levels of coverage, i.e. 40, 60, 80 and 100%, were applied at the household level with treated houses having only one bed net. By using Latin hypercube sampling scheme, parameters governing killing, diverting and personal protection of net users were evaluated for their relative roles in containing mosquito populations, entomological inoculation rates (EIRs) and malaria incidence. Results: There were substantial gaps in coverage between households and individual persons, and 100% household coverage resulted in circa 50% coverage of the population. The results show that applications of ITNs could give rise to varying impacts on population-level metrics depending on values of parameters governing interactions of mosquitoes and treated nets at the individual level. The most significant factor in determining effectiveness was killing capability of treated nets. Strong excito-repellent effect of impregnated nets might lead to higher risk exposure to non-bed net users. Conclusion: With variabilities of vector mosquitoes in host-seeking behaviours and the responses to treated nets, it is anticipated that scale-up applications of INTs might produce varying degrees of success dependent on local entomological and epidemiological contexts. This study highlights that increased ITN coverage led to significant reduction in risk exposure and malaria incidence only when treated nets yielded high killing effects. It is necessary to test efficacy of treated nets on local dominant vector mosquitoes, at least in laboratory, for monitoring and evaluation of ITN programmes.

Human intrusion into these former remote habitats through deforestation and bush meat hunting leads to an increased contact between humans and wildlife, and between humans and insect vectors (Leendertz et al., 2006; Jones et al., 2008; Gillespie et al., 2009). In the course of our research on pathogen transmission in this type of ecosystem, samples from non-human primates and other nammalian hosts living in tropical rainforests as well as humans living around rainforests are collected and analysed at the Robert Koch-Institut. One of the aims of our studies is to evaluate the risk of emergence of new zoonoses in the human population. We specifically focus on screening humans with high exposure to blood and organs of wild primates through bushmeat hunting and handling, but pathogen transmission from other possible hosts are also analysed. Chimpanzees can be seen as a natural system to study disease transmission among primates. In the last years we have shown that simian retroviruses, such as the Simian T-Cell Leukemia Virus-1 (STLV-1) and Foamy-Viruses (SFV) are transmitted from one non-human primate to another. Based on molecular epidemiological findings as well as prevalence data in different age classes of wild chimpanzees, we could show that the main transmission of these viruses is through the hunter-prey relationship that exists between red colobus monkeys and chimpanzees (Leendertz et al., 2004a, b; Leendertz et al., 2008). These findings in wild primates, which are known to be hunted by humans, inspired us to perform a study focused on the human population in the area together with the Institut Pasteur Cote d'Ivoire, and we found evidence of virus transmission from non-human primates to humans. Furthermore, we investigated several outbreaks of respiratory diseases in wild chimpanzees. In necropsy samples from deceased chimpanzees we detected two new strains of S. pneumoniae (Chi et al., 2007). In addition, the chimpanzees were infected with human paramyxoviruses (Kondgen et al., 2008). This was the first description of anthropoozonotic transmission of human respiratory viruses to great apes, identifying that human diseases are an important threat to these endangered species. In order to investigate the influence of ecological changes on the prevalence of mosquitoes and arboviruses, we systematically captured mosquitoes in and around tropical rainforests with different degrees of ecological changes. Firstly, we detected new viruses of the families Flavi-, Bunya- and Coronaviruses (Junglen et al., 2009), Secondly, we could show that ecological changes had a dramatic influence on the distribution and prevalence of mosquito and viruses, indicating that disturbance of the rainforest increases the risk of transmission of arboviruses to the human population (Junglen et al., in print).

In order to better understand how deforestation affects the prevalence of vector-borne infectious diseases in wildlife, nine paired sites were sampled (disturbed vs. undisturbed habitats) in Southern Cameroon. We studied the diversity, prevalence and distribution of avian malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp.) and other related haemosporidians (species of Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon) from these sites in two widespread species of African rainforest birds, the yellow-whiskered greenbul (Andropadus latirostris, Pycnonotidae) and the olive sunbird (Cyanomitra olivacea, Nectariniidae). Twenty-six mitochondrial cytochrome b lineages were identified: 20 Plasmodium lineages and 6 Haemoproteus lineages. These lineages showed no geographic specificity, nor significant differences in lineage diversity between habitat types. However, we found that the prevalence of Leucocytozoon and Haemoproteus infections were significantly higher in undisturbed than in deforested habitats (Leucocytozoon spp. 50.3% vs. 35.8%, Haemoproteus spp. 16.3% vs. 10.8%). We also found higher prevalence for all haemosporidian parasites in C. olivacea than in A. latirostris species (70.2% vs. 58.2%). Interestingly, we found one morphospecies of Plasmodium in C. olivacea, as represented by a clade of related lineages, showed increased prevalence at disturbed sites, while another showed a decrease, testifying to different patterns of transmission, even among closely related lineages of avian malaria, in relation to deforestation. Our work demonstrates that anthropogenic habitat change can affect host-parasite systems and result in opposing trends in prevalence of haemosporidian parasites in wild bird populations.

Association Between Habitat Size, Brushtail Possum Density, and the Mosquito Fauna of Native Forests in the Auckland Region, New Zealand	ECOHEALTH			English	Article						habitat fragmentation; invasion; mosquito; forest; phytotelmata; brushtail possum	AEDES-NOTOSCRIPTUS DIPTERA; CULICIDAE; FRAGMENTATION; BIODIVERSITY; CONSEQUENCES; QUEENSLAND; INVASIONS; DISPERSAL; VECTORS	Human activities have been causing dramatic and unprecedented changes to the Earth's ecosystems, and are a primary factor associated with biological invasions. Disturbed and fragmented habitats allow some vector mosquitoes to thrive. The New Zealand landscape has been extensively modified since the arrival of humans, and there is accumulating evidence that the distribution of mosquitoes is being altered as a result of anthropogenic environmental changes. This study aimed to assess whether forest habitat size affected the community composition of mosquitoes, and whether the density of the introduced brushtail possum would benefit exotic mosquito species that feed primarily on mammal hosts. Extensive sampling of the mosquito community was carried out using dry ice-baited light traps, oviposition traps, and larval surveys. The results provided the first experimental evidence in New Zealand that changes in forest habitat size affect the indigenous and introduced mosquito fauna differently. The proportion of native species making up the mosquito community appears to be steadily reduced as native forest habitats become smaller. In contrast, the opposite pattern appears to occur for the introduced vector Aedes notoscriptus. Although there was a trend indicating that possums may have a negative impact on a native species (Culex pervigilans), the impact of these animals on the mosquito fauna remains unclear. The evidence suggests that the conservation of large pristine forest ecosystems in New Zealand could have human health implications.	[Derraik, Jose G.

EFFICACY OF RESIDUAL BIFENTHRIN APPLIED TO LANDSCAPE VEGETATION AGAINST AEDES ALBOPICTUS	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MOSQUITO CONTROL ASSOCIATION			English	Article						Aedes albopictus; bifenthrin; residual pesticide; mosquito control	CULEX-PIPIENS; CULICIDAE; DIPTERA; NORTH; INSECTICIDES; ARBOVIRUSES; MOSQUITOS; FOLIAGE	The daytime biting mosquito Aedes albopictus is a nuisance pest commonly found in suburban yards. The recommended Course of treatment for Ae. albopictus is to keep yards free of water-holding containers; however, infestations may require additional control methods such as residual pesticide applications to vegetation. Five plants commonly found in yards or in uncultivated areas in Gainesville, FL were chosen as substrates for evaluation of the effectiveness of residual bifenthrin against 5-7-day-old female Ae. albopictus. Knockdown of mosquitoes after I h of exposure was highest the day of and 7 days after treatment. Plant species clearly impacted the effectiveness of residual bifenthrin. One-hour knockdown 7 days after treatment remained high (>62%) only on azalea and holly bush vegetation. Knockdown counts 24 h after exposure demonstrated that residual efficacy of bifenthrin was highest on azalea, with >77% mortality for up to 35 days. Additional bioassays revealed significant differences in the knockdown rates of male, female, gravid, and blood-fed Ae. albopictus exposed to residual bifenthrin treatments, with the highest knockdown observed on the day of and 7 days after treatment.

Relative impacts of competition and predation change across a gradient of habitat size and permanence. Asymmetrical competition is common and ecological context changes competitive advantage, potentially facilitating landscape-level coexistence of competitors. Predator effects oil mosquito populations sometimes depend oil habitat structure and on emergent effects of multiple predators, particularly interference among predators. Nonlethal effects of predators oil mosquito oviposition, foraging, and life history are common, and their consequences for populations and for mosquito-borne disease are poorly understood.

An. gambiae mosquitoes were fed with P falciparum-infected blood through membrane feeders. Fed mosquitoes were placed in houses in forested and deforested areas in a highland area (1,500 m above sea level) and monitored for parasite development. Deforested sites had higher temperatures and relative humidities, and the overall infection rate of mosquitoes was increased compared with that in forested sites. Sporozoites appeared on average 1.1 days earlier in deforested areas. Vectorial capacity was estimated to be 77.7% higher in the deforested site than in the forested site. We showed that deforestation changes microclimates, leading to more rapid sporogonic development of P. falciparum and to a marked increase of malaria risk in the western Kenyan highland.

Landscape, demographic, entomological, and climatic associations with human disease incidence of West Nile virus in the state of Iowa, USA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH GEOGRAPHICS			English	Article							MOSQUITOS DIPTERA; CULICIDAE; TRANSMISSION; AMPLIFICATION; CALIFORNIA; EPIDEMIC; DYNAMICS; RIVER	Background: West Nile virus ( WNV) emerged as a threat to public and veterinary health in the Midwest United States in 2001 and continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality annually. To investigate biotic and abiotic factors associated with disease incidence, cases of reported human disease caused by West Nile virus ( WNV) in the state of Iowa were aggregated by census block groups in Iowa for the years 2002 - 2006. Spatially explicit data on landscape, demographic, and climatic conditions were collated and analyzed by census block groups. Statistical tests of differences between means and distributions of landscape, demographic, and climatic variables for census block groups with and without WNV disease incidence were carried out. Entomological data from Iowa were considered at the state level to add context to the potential ecological events taking place. Results: Numerous statistically significant differences were shown in the means and distributions of various landscape and demographic variables for census block groups with and without WNV disease incidence. Census block groups with WNV disease incidence had significantly lower population densities than those without. Landscape variables showing differences included stream density, road density, land cover compositions, presence of irrigation, and presence of animal feeding operations. Statistically significant differences in the annual means of precipitations, dew point, and minimum temperature for both the year of WNV disease incidence and the prior year, were detected in at least one year of the analysis for each parameter. However, the differences were not consistent between years. Conclusion: The analysis of human WNV disease incidence by census block groups in Iowa demonstrated unique landscape, demographic, and climatic associations. Our results indicate that multiple ecological WNV transmission dynamics are most likely taking place in Iowa. In 2003 and 2006, drier conditions were associated with WNV disease incidence. In a significant novel finding, rural agricultural settings were shown to be strongly associated with human WNV disease incidence in Iowa.

We used remotely sensed vegetation indices to discriminate among mosquito habitats within a densely populated urban environment in New Haven, CT. ASTER derived vegetation indices were identified for 16 sites where adult mosquitoes were trapped over the summer of 2004. Canonical correlation analysis showed a significant relationship between the environmental variables (normalized difference vegetation index, disease/water stress index and distance to water) and four local West Nile virus competent vectors (Cx. pipiens, Cx. restuans, Cx. salinarius, and Ae. vexans) (0.93, P = 0.03) explaining 86% of the variance in the environmental and mosquito measures. Sites were clustered based on these remotely sensed environmental variables. Three clusters were identified which provide insight into the distribution of West Nile virus vectors in an urban area. Identification of habitat differences of mosquitoes within the urban landscape has important implications for understanding West Nile virus transmission and for control of vector-competent mosquito species.

Efficacy of replicate applications was evaluated by measuring mortality among caged sentinel mosquitoes, by evaluating changes in host-seeking abundance at replicated dry ice-baited traps positioned along intersecting east-west and north-south transects, and by differential recapture patterns of marked females released near traps in the sprayed central core and unsprayed control areas. Sentinel mortality agreed well with estimates of droplet density measured by slide spinners and was affected by 1) distance of cages from the truck route; 2) landscape features, such as tree lines that created wind shadows; 3) irregular landscape that disrupted the particle cloud; 4) low wind speed that failed to carry the droplet cloud through the environment; and 5) failure of the droplets to penetrate dead airspace within stands of vegetation. Despite variable sentinel mortality, Culex tarsalis relative abundance in rural landscapes within and around our study areas always declined after ULV applications. Concurrent decreases in abundance at traps within sprayed and adjoining unsprayed areas confounded our estimates of percentage of control using Mulla's formula, which compares abundance in sprayed and unsprayed areas pre- and postspray. ULV applications significantly affected recapture patterns, in that recapture rates within the spray zone usually were significantly less than in the unsprayed zone. Collectively, our data indicated that ground ULV applications measurably reduced Cx. tarsalis abundance in rural areas of the Coachella Valley but that further evaluations may be necessary to validate efficacy on Culex quinquefasciatus populations in residential communities.

To determine if temperature, precipitation, or degree of urbanization were similarly important in the number of potential mosquito vectors for West Nile virus in the moderately temperate climate of western Washington, mosquitoes were collected using CDC carbondioxide/light traps set throughout the Seattle region during the summers of 2003 and 2004. The type and abundance of recovered species were compared to ecological correlates. Temperature and mosquito abundance were positively correlated, while precipitation was not strongly correlated with numbers of mosquitoes. Potential WNV mosquito vectors were most abundant in urban and suburban sites, including sites near communal roosts of American crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos). Exurban sites had the greatest vector species diversity, and Culex pipiens was the most abundant species throughout the region.

Po'ouli landscape bioinformatics models predict energetics, behavior, diets, and distribution on Maui	INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Annual Meeting of the Society-for-Integrative-and-Comparative-Biology	JAN 04-08, 2006	Orlando, FL				MECHANISTIC ECOLOGY; SOLAR-RADIATION; MAMMALS; BIOENERGETICS; CONSERVATION; PHYSIOLOGY; AMAKIHI; CLIMATE	This study uses a spatially explicit microclimate/biophysical approach to examine the potential distribution of the Po'ouli on Maui to find either new habitats to search for existence or refine search efforts in previously occupied areas. We used specific physiological and behavioral ecology bird data, and Po'ouli morphological and spectral data obtained from museum specimens to address ecological and conservation-related questions about the Po'ouli that are other-wise very difficult to quantify. Laboratory and field tested microclimate and biophysical-behavioral animal computer models were integrated with remote sensing technologies. To show that the generic microclimate and enclotherm models can predict metabolic and water loss requirements of Hawaiian Honeycreepers, we used the 2 species with known physiological properties, the Hawaiian Amakihi, Hemignathus virens, and the Hawaiian Anianiau, Hemignathus parvus. Predictions were within experimental measurement error of the laboratory measurements. Then using field rather than laboratory conditions as input data, we predict the field distribution of the Amakihi on Maui as the first spatial test of the models applied to birds. Results are consistent with Amakihi field distribution data. Fossils show that the Po'ouli once lived on Maui at low elevations in dry/mesic habitats on a likely diet of native tree snails and insects. The arrival of lethal mosquito-borne avian malaria in Hawaii exterminated low elevation Po'ouli forcing a population shift to mountain rainforests and possibly a snail diet instead of insects. To explore the maximum consequences of such a diet shift we assumed exclusive diets of snails versus insects at both low and high elevations. Snail diets require similar to 4 times higher foraging rates than do insect diets, making a predominantly snail diet an unlikely prospect for the Po'ouli. Landscape scale simulations suggest that a snail diet would force a Po'ouli distribution inconsistent with observations. A predominantly insect diet is consistent with distribution observations. We show that as local environmental conditions change across the landscape in space and diurnal/seasonal time it is possible to quantify animal physiological and behavioral consequences of those variations in their local environment. This enables quantification of the requisite spatial and temporal distribution and amount or availability of resources that may affect species' potential for survival, growth, reproduction and distribution.

Two species [great egret (Ardea alba) and snowy egret (Egretta thula)] nest in mixed-species colonies on islands in Narragansett Bay and regularly forage in adjacent salt marshes. We surveyed 13 salt marshes approximately twice weekly during the breeding and post-breeding seasons in 2001 and 2002. Based on resource selection functions, foraging great and snowy egrets strongly preferred pools within salt marshes, while mosquito control ditches were rarely used. Foraging egrets were never detected in stands of common reed (Phragmites australis). The number of egrets using individual marshes varied considerably, although density estimates were far less variable. Salt marsh area was better at predicting the mean number of foraging egrets using a marsh than landscape-level parameters, such as distance to the nearest nesting colony or the total area of salt marsh within 5 km. Carefully designed salt marsh restoration projects could benefit local egret populations because it appears that foraging habitat availability may be a limiting factor. To ensure use by foraging egrets, salt marsh restoration designs should increase the availability of pool and open water habitat, reduce common reed, and modify deep ditches and channels to make them more accessible for foraging egrets.

Thus, heterogeneity in human biting reflects underlying spatial heterogeneity in the distribution and suitability of larval habitat as well as inherent differences in the attractiveness, suitability and distribution of blood-meal hosts. One of the possible strategies of malaria control is to identify local vector species and then attack water bodies that contain their larvae. Methods: Biting and host seeking, not oviposition, have been the focus of most previous studies of mosquitoes and malaria transmission. This study presents a mathematical model that incorporates mosquito oviposition behaviour. Results: The model demonstrates that oviposition is one potential factor explaining heterogeneous biting and vector distribution in a landscape with a heterogeneous distribution of larval habitat. Adult female mosquitoes tend to aggregate around places where they oviposit, thereby increasing the risk of malaria, regardless of the suitability of the habitat for larval development. Thus, a water body may be unsuitable for adult mosquito emergence, but simultaneously, be a source for human malaria. Conclusion: Larval density may be a misleading indicator of a habitat's importance for malaria control. Even if mosquitoes could be lured to oviposit in sprayed larval habitats, this would not necessarily mitigate - and might aggravate - the risk of malaria transmission. Forcing mosquitoes to fly away from humans in search of larval habitat may be a more efficient way to reduce the risk of malaria than killing larvae. Thus, draining, fouling, or filling standing water where mosquitoes oviposit can be more effective than applying larvicide.

We experimentally examined the relative impact of native and introduced predatory fish on a temporary wetland amphibian assemblage to determine whether these predators exert distinct (unique or non-substitutable) or equivalent (similar) impacts on prey. Predatory fish included the eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki), golden topminnow (Fundulus chrysotus), flagfish (Jordanella floridae), and the introduced walking catfish (Clarias batrachus). The tadpole assemblage included four common species known to co-occur in temporary wetlands in south-central Florida, USA: the oak toad (Bufo quercicus), pinewoods treefrog (Hyla femoralis), squirrel treefrog (Hyla squirella), and eastern narrowmouth toad (Gastrophryne carolinensis). Tadpoles were exposed to different predators in wading pools under conditions similar to those found in surrounding temporary wetlands (particularly in terms of substrate type, the degree of habitat complexity, and temperature). Native predators were similar with respect to predation rate and prey selectivity, suggesting similar energy requirements and foraging behavior. Conversely, native fish predators, especially G. holbrooki, were distinct from the introduced C. batrachus. In contrast to expectations, C. batrachus were less voracious predators than native fish, particularly G. holbrooki. Moreover, survival of G. carolinensis and H. femoralis were higher in the presence of C. batrachus than G. holbrooki. We suggest that C. batrachus was a less efficient predator than native fish because the foraging behavior of this species resulted in low predator-prey encounter rates, and thus predation rate. In combination with a related field study, our results suggest that native predatory fish play a stronger role than C. batrachus in influencing the spatial distribution and abundance of temporary wetland amphibians in the landscape.

Using CO2 traps placed inside and outside of colonies, we found that total mosquito abundance increased significantly with the number of active cliff swallow nests at a colony site. We found no effect of date or weather conditions on the number of mosquitoes caught at the different sites. By classifying the landscape from aerial photographs within a 2-km-diameter circle centered on each colony site, we found no significant relationships between habitat type near a colony site and cliff swallow colony size or mosquito abundance. Proximity to livestock could not account for our results. Culex tarsalis was proportionately more likely to be caught inside a colony than at traps 30 m away, but the proportion of C. tarsalis inside a colony did not vary with colony size. Our results cannot be explained by date- or weather-related sampling artifacts or by differences in habitat between sites. Most likely, mosquitoes, especially A. vexans, are attracted to the vicinity of large cliff swallow colonies.

J	Barnes, DKA				Barnes, DKA			Hermit crabs, humans and Mozambique mangroves	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						hermit crabs; mangrove forest; niche; resource	QUIRIMBA ISLAND; GASTROPOD SHELLS; ECOLOGY; RESOURCE; PREDATION; COMPETITION; COEXISTENCE	There is a complex interrelationship between upper shore hermit crabs (such as Coenobita sp. and Clibanarius sp.), coastal human populations and mangrove forests in Mozambique. The abundance, activity, shell selection and behaviour of three species of hermit crab are related to the level of mangrove cover. With increased density of mangrove trees, the study species of hermit crab changed in abundance, tended to become diurnal, spent more time feeding and were clustered in larger groups when doing so, and selected longer spired shells. All five of the same variables are also linked to the proximity and activity of humans through both direct and indirect actions. Direct effects included a tendency to nocturnal activity with proximity to human activity; indirect effects included increased and more clumped food supplies, and shell middens from intertidal harvesting and deforestation. Mangroves are important to local human populations as well as to hermit crabs, for a wide variety of (similar) reasons. Mangroves provide storm shelter, fisheries and fishery nursery grounds for adjacent human settlements, but they also harbour mosquito populations and their removal provides valuable building materials and fuel. Hermit crabs may be useful (indirectly) to coastal human populations by being a source of food to certain commercial species, and by quickly consuming rotting/discarded food and faeces (thereby reducing disease and pests). They can also cause minor problems to coastal human populations because they use shells of (fisheries) target mollusc species and can be more abundant than the living molluscs, thereby slowing down effective hand collection through confusion over identification. The mixture of positive and negative attributes that the three groups impart to each other in the Quirimba Archipelago. northern Mozambique, is discussed.

Vegetation and other landscape features used by roosting or nesting birds at night dictate their exposure to nocturnally active host-seeking Culex tarsalis Coquillett and therefore to western equine encephalomyelitis and St. Louis encephalitis viruses. Precipitin tests on 645 Cx. tarsalis that were collected resting and host-seeking near the Salton Sea in Coachella Valley, CA, indicated that passeriform birds (64%) and rabbits (25%) were the most frequent bloodmeal hosts and that the percentage of females feeding on birds varied temporally as an inverse function of mosquito abundance. Blood meals were not taken from communally roosting water birds. The spatial distribution of host-seeking females then was investigated by deploying dry ice baited traps within seven sites representative of habitats found along the Salton Sea. Mosquito catch was greatest at traps within elevated vegetation such as Tamarisk, mesquite, cattails, and orchards and lowest at traps positioned at snags over water, sand bars, open fields, and within housing in a small rural community. These data indicate that host-seeking Cx. tarsalis females congregated at specific landscape features that were not necessarily associated with large concentrations of potential bloodmeal hosts.

Each environmental change, whether occurring as a natural phenomenon or through human intervention, changes the ecological balance and context within which disease hosts or vectors and parasites breed, develop, and transmit disease. Each species occupies a particular ecological niche and vector species sub-populations are distinct behaviourally and genetically as they adapt to man-made environments. Most zoonotic parasites display three distinct life cycles: sylvatic, zoonotic, and anthroponotic. In adapting to changed environmental conditions, including reduced non human population and increased human population, some vectors display conversion from a primarily zoophyllic to primarily anthrophyllic orientation. Deforestation and ensuing changes in landuse, human settlement, commercial development, road construction, water control systems (dams, canals, irrigation systems, reservoirs), and climate, singly, and in combination have been accompanied by global increases in morbidity and mortality from emergent parasitic disease. The replacement of forests with crop farming, ranching, and raising small animals can create supportive habitats for parasites and their host vectors. When the landuse of deforested areas changes, the pattern of human settlement is altered and habitat fragmentation may provide opportunities for exchange and transmission of parasites to the heretofore uninfected humans. Construction of water control projects can lead to shifts in such vector populations as snails and mosquitoes and their parasites. Construction of roads in previously inaccessible forested areas can lead to erosion, and stagnant ponds by blocking the Row of streams when the water rises during the rainy season. The combined effects of environmentally detrimental changes in local landuse and alterations in global climate disrupt the natural ecosystem and can increase the risk of transmission of parasitic diseases to the human population.

Overall, 74 WEE and one SLE isolates were obtained from 222,455 Cx. tarsalis females tested in 4,988 pools. In addition, 133 and 40 seroconversions were detected in 28 chicken flocks, and 143 and 27 of 20,192 sera tested from 149 species of wild birds were positive for antibodies to WEE and SLE, respectively. WEE was active in all three valleys, whereas SLE only was detected in Coachella Valley. Seroconversions in sentinel chickens provided the most sensitive indication of enzootic activity and were correlated with seroprevalence rates in wild birds. Avian seroprevalence rates did not provide an early warning of pending enzootic activity. in chickens, because positive sera from after hatching year birds collected during spring most probably were the result of infections acquired during the previous season. Few seroconversions were detected among banded recaptured birds collected during spring and early summer. Age and resident status, but not sex, were significant risk factors for wild bird infection, with the highest seroprevalence rates among after hatching year individuals of permanent resident species. Migrants (with the exception of mourning doves) and winter resident species rarely were positive. House finches, house sparrows, Gambel's quail, California quail, common ground doves, and mourning doves were most frequently positive for antibodies. The initial detection of enzootic activity each summer coincided closely with the appearance of hatching year birds of these species in our study areas, perhaps indicating their role in virus amplification. Bird species most frequently positive roosted or nested in elevated upland vegetation, sites where Cx. tarsalis host-seeking females hunt most frequently. These serosurveys provided important background information for planned host competence and chronic infection studies.

WEE was detected during 1995 by the seroconversion of sentinel chickens concurrently at sites within and outside of the area supporting Ae. dorsalis. WEE was not detected during 1994 or 1996; neither was WEE detected by seroconversion of sentinel rabbits nor by isolation from host-seeking females of either the primary vector, Culex tarsalis Coquillett (42,083 females tested in 913 pools), or Ae. dorsalis (10,804 females tested in 245 pools and 1,940 adults reared from field-collected immatures tested in 72 pools).

ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY			English	Article						mosquito control; red-winged blackbird; wetlands	ORGANISMS	We found no convincing evidence that reproduction, growth, or foraging behavior of red-winced blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) were negatively impacted by treatments of wetlands with either Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti, applied as Vectobac-G granules) or methoprene (applied as Altosid sand granules). Most red-winged blackbird parameters examined varied annually and some differences were found before treatments began. In all cases, differences found before treatments were either found again during the treatment years or no patterns existed to suggest impacts of mosquito control treatments. Only 1 of the 22 variables examined indicated a significant difference between a treatment group and the controls; males in Bti-treated sites were larger than males in control sires during the treatment years. Clutch size indicated a significant treatment-by-year interaction and was higher in control areas as compared with Bti-treated areas in 3 of the 6 years of study; 2 years occurred before any treatments were applied. Data from benthic aquatic insect studies showed that aquatic insects were depressed in wetlands treated with both methoprene and Bti In July and August. However, it is unlikely that food available to avian species in these wetlands was lower during the breeding season (May and June). Other portions of the avian life cycle that may be affected include the dispersal of young birds within or to these sites and individuals that use wetlands during migration. Impacts on these aspects of the avian community and landscape-level effects of treatments were not addressed.

Of 85,197 anophelines collected in 1,276 paired indoor and outdoor landing catches, 40.4% were Anopheles koliensis Owen, 36.7% An. punctulatus Donitz, 14.3% An. karwari (James), 4.9% An. farauti s.l. Laveran, 3.1% An, longirostris Brug, and 0.7% An. bancroftii Giles. Maps of average indoor biting rates were produced using a Bayesian conditional autoregressive model which allowed for heterogeneities in sampling effort over time and space. Differences in spatial distributions among species were observed among and within villages and were related to the distribution of larval habitats and vegetation. Abundance of An. punctulatus and An. koliensis decreased with distance from the main waterway and probably from a sage swamp forest at 6 villages in North Wosera. Abundance of An. punctulatus was associated negatively with those of An. farauti s.l., An. longirostris, and An. bancroftii. The latter 3 species also had relatively low ratios of indoor-to-outdoor biting rates, and earlier biting times than An. punctulatus. Human blood indices of at least 0.79 were observed for all species except An. bancroftii. Abundance of all 6 species was correlated temporally with recent rainfall, but An. koliensis, An. karwari, and An. longirostris showed greater temporal variability than the other species. An. punctulatus and An. koliensis tended to occur together in time and space (index of association, I=0.85). Weaker associations were seen between An. farauti s.l, and An. longirostris (I=0.44) and An. koliensis and An. karwari (I=0.34). The most frequently collected species occurred together and were concentrated near the Amugu river; the remaining species tended to occur together but in different parts of the Wosera area. The importance of understanding ecological requirements of the different Anopheles vectors and their association with key household and landscape features are dis cussed in relation to malaria transmission and control.

An. albimanus adults were collected weekly in each village using UV-light traps between July 1991 and August 1992. Based on rainfall, the study was divided into 6 seasonal periods. Villages were considered to have high mosquito abundance when >5 mosquitoes per trap per night were collected during any 1 of the 6 seasonal periods. The extension and frequency of 11 land cover types surrounding villages were determined using aerial photographs and subsequently verified through field surveys. Elevation was the main landscape feature that separated villages with low and high mosquito abundance. All villages with high mosquito abundance were below 25 m. Transitional and mangrove land cover were found only in the high mosquito abundance group. Flooded areas as potential breeding sites and potential adult resting sites in unmanaged pastures were significantly more frequent in areas surrounding villages with high mosquito abundance. No significant differences in density of cattle and horses were found among village groups. Overall, surrounding breeding sites located at low elevations in flooded unmanaged pastures seemed to be the most important determinants of An. albimanus adult abundance in the villages.

Both viruses repeatedly were detected first at a salt marsh adjacent to the Salton Sea in the southeastern corner df the study area and then disseminated to the northwest to freshwater marsh, agricultural, and residential habitats. Virus dissemination was relatively slow (<1 km/d) and may have been accomplished by dispersive host-seeking mosquitoes. Repeated early-season recovery of virus activity indicated that both viruses may persist interseasonally in salt marsh habitat.

Selected examples are considered from viral and parasitic infections (arboviruses, malaria, filariases, Chagas Disease and schistosomiasis) where disease patterns have been directly or indirectly influenced by loss of natural tropical forests. A wide range of activities have resulted in deforestation. These include colonisation and settlement, transmigrant programmes, logging, agricultural activities to provide for cash crops, mining, hydropower development and fuelwood collection. Each activity influences the prevalence, incidence and distribution of vector-borne disease. Three main regions are considered - South America, West & Central Africa and South-East Asia. In each, documented changes in vector ecology and behaviour and disease pattern have occurred. Such changes result from human activity at the forest interface and within the forest. They include both deforestation and reafforestation programmes. Deforestation, or activities associated with it, have produced new habitats for Anopheles darlingi mosquitoes and have caused malaria epidemics in South America. The different species complexes in South-East Asia (A. dirus, A. minimus, A. balabacensis) have been affected in different ways by forest clearance with different impacts on malaria incidence. The ability of zoophilic vectors to adapt to human blood as an alternative source of food and to become associated with human dwellings (peridomestic behaviour) have influenced the distribution of the leishmaniases in South America. Certain species of sandflies (Lutzomyia intermedia, Lu. longipalpis, Lu. whitmani), which were originally zoophilic and sylvatic, have adapted to feeding on humans in peridomestic and even periurban situations. The changes in behaviour of reservoir hosts and the ability of pathogens to adapt to new reservoir hosts in the newly-created habitats also influence the patterns of disease. In anthroponotic infections, such as Plasmodium, Onchocerca and Wuchereria, changes in disease patterns and vector ecology may be more difficult to detect. Detailed knowledge of vector species and species complexes is needed in relation to changing climate associated with deforestation. The distributions of the Anopheles gambiae and Simulium damnosum species complexes in West Africa are examples. There have been detailed longitudinal studies of Anopheles gambiae populations in different ecological zones of West Africa. Studies on Simulium damnosum cytoforms (using chromosome identification methods) in the Onchocerciasis Control Programme were necessary to detect changes in distribution of species in relation to changed habitats. These examples underline the need for studies on the taxonomy of medically-important insects in parallel with long-term observations on changing habitats. In some circumstances destruction of the forest has reduced or even removed disease transmission (e.g. S. neavei-transmitted Onchocerca in Kenya). Whilst the process of deforestation can be expected to continue, hopefully at a decreased rate, it is expected that unpredictable and sometimes rapid changes in disease patterns will pose problems for the public health services.

The vast majority of endogenous small RNAs produced by the siRNA and piRNA pathways originate from repetitive or transposable elements (TE). In D. melanogaster, TE-derived endogenous siRNAs and piRNAs are involved in genome surveillance and maintenance of genome integrity. In the medically relevant malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae TEs constitute 12-16% of the genome size. Genetic variations induced by TE activities are known to shape the genome landscape and to alter the fitness in An. gambiae. Results: Here, using bioinformatics approaches we analyzed the small RNA data sets from 6 libraries formally reported in a previous study and examined the expression of the mixed germline/somatic siRNAs and piRNAs produced in adult An. gambiae females. We characterized a large population of TE-derived endogenous siRNAs and piRNAs, which constitutes 56-60% of the total siRNA and piRNA reads in the analysed libraries. Moreover, we identified a number of protein coding genes producing gene-specific siRNAs and piRNAs that were generally expressed at much lower levels than the TE-associated small RNAs. Detailed sequence analysis revealed that An. gambiae piRNAs were produced by both ping-pong dependent (TE-associated piRNAs) and independent mechanisms (genic piRNAs). Similarly to D. melanogaster, more than 90% of the detected piRNAs were produced from TE-associated clusters in An. gambiae. We also found that biotic stress as blood feeding and infection with Plasmodium parasite, the etiological agent of malaria, modulated the expression levels of the endogenous siRNAs and piRNAs in An. gambiae. Conclusions: We identified a large and diverse set of the endogenously derived siRNAs and piRNAs that share common and distinct aspects of small RNA expression across insect species, and inferred their impact on TE and gene activity in An. gambiae. The TE-specific small RNAs produced by both the siRNA and piRNA pathways represent an important aspect of genome stability and genetic variation, which might have a strong impact on the evolution of the genome and vector competence in the malaria mosquitoes.","","BMC GENOMICS","",NA,"Background: The siRNA and piRNA pathways have been shown in insects to be essential for regulation of gene expression and defence against exogenous and endogenous genetic elements (viruses and transposable elements).

Humans living close to these wetlands express concerns about future mosquito nuisance situations, and request the necessary distance between human occupation and wetlands to avoid such problems. Wetland managers need to know the distance required, as well as the type of management needed for such buffer or barrier zones. Here we performed an extensive literature survey to collect quantitative information on mosquito flight distance and the relevant environmental conditions. Mosquitoes have an average maximum flight distance of between 50 m and 50 km, depending on the species. Long-distance or migratory flights are strongly related to species ecological preferences and physiology, are survived by few specimens, and do not relate to nuisance situations. Nuisance-related or non-oriented flights are also species-specific and cover much shorter distances-between 25 m and 6 km for the 23 species analyzed. Based on these results, we made regression-based estimations of the percentages of the population that cross certain distances. A 90% reduction in breeding site population density would require minimal distances of 56 m for Anopheles saperoi and 8.6 km for Anopheles sinensis, and much greater distances for Aedes vexans, Culex quinquefasciatus, and Culiseta morsitans. Little useful information was available regarding the environmental conditions under which non-oriented flights took place. Qualitatively, the review showed that flight capacity was influenced by landscape structure, meteorological conditions (temperature, humidity, and illumination), and species physiology (energy available for flight). Overall, our findings suggest that predictions regarding the construction of barrier zones around breeding sites can be made based on mosquito and host density and human nuisance perception, and that barrier zone usefulness strongly depends on the mosquito species involved. Additional quantitative research is needed to better document the non-oriented dispersal patterns of the mosquitoes that populate rewetted and newly constructed wetlands, and the effects of vegetation types in barrier zones on mosquito densities.
